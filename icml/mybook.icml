    <Content>CAT is an Aboriginal not-for-profit organization that works towards sustainable livelihoods for those living in remote communities, and conducts research into, and development of, appropriate technologies. CAT was formed in the 1980s when the outstation movement was gaining momentum, and much of its work today is still focused on small remote communities, known as ‘outstations’. In CAT’s definition, appropriate technologies meet the economic, cultural, environmental and social needs of the people, and design and development occurs through consultation and collaboration with communities. In his history of CAT, Alan Mayne writes that CAT’s ‘appropriate technologies’, ‘together with the research and design process that produces them, their regular servicing and the training and education programmes that inform their use, are making a difference in communities throughout remote Australia’.</Content>

    <Content>The CLC is a statutory body set up under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (NT). The CLC’s history is deeply imbued with Aboriginal justice, recognition and the fight for land rights. The primary functions of the CLC are to help traditional landowners in the management of their country in the southern half of the Northern Territory. Through advocacy and policy work, the ninety-member Council also represents the interests, rights and concerns of Aboriginal people across regions.</Content>

    <Content>The CLC believes that the provision of access to communication technologies is an essential service in remote communities. The focus of much of their work in this area has been on addressing disadvantages in service and access levels for remote residents, affordability issues, rights to service and increasing the choice of communication options for remote communities. The CLC remains concerned about the future of small remote communities in Central Australia because of a lack of funding commitment from both levels of government, and an increasing move to prioritize larger communities when allocating funding. This is despite a robust determination of traditional owners to remain living on or near their country.</Content>

The Institute is also a node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation (CCI), led by Stuart Cunningham, and our research in Central Australia was conducted as part of CCI’s wider research program on the social, economic and cultural dimensions of broadband services.</Content>

    <Content>The research was funded in three phases. ACCAN’s Grants Scheme funded the first phase of the project (the ‘baseline study’) in 2010. As the peak consumer representation body in communications, ACCAN awards grants each year for research and advocacy projects that align with its goal of available, accessible and affordable communications for all Australians. We are very grateful to ACCAN for kickstarting this research, and for continuing on the project after that grant concluded. CCI’s support, especially in the early stages of the work, was also critical.</Content>

In particular, CAT provided Andrew’s time, CLC provided Alyson’s time (and car), and Swinburne contributed Ellie and Julian’s time.

In particular, we thank Jessie Simpson and Roseanne Holmes, who worked with Ellie and Alyson to administer the Ali Curung survey, and provided invaluable cultural advice regarding questions to be included. Derek Walker assisted Peter Donohoe with the ‘men’s side’ of the Ali Curung survey. We are grateful to both of them for helping rectify the gender imbalance in our original survey results. We also thank Sammy Butcher at Papunya for his support of the study; Ashton Kealy, Mary McMullen, Rebecca Smith and Ryan Raggatt for their assistance in the computer room; and Jenny and Blair McFarland at the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service (CAYLUS) for providing ongoing information about ICT arrangements in the MacDonnell region.</Content>

    <Content>Finally, the genesis of this work was a conversation between two old friends in 2009: Julian Thomas, Director of the Swinburne Institute for Social Research, and the late Peter Taylor when he was CEO of CAT. Ellie Rennie (who was living in Alice Springs and working for the Swinburne Institute) was introduced to CAT through that connection, and began to explore the issue of the digital divide with Andrew Crouch in 2009. The project would not have happened if it were not for Peter’s passion for communications and his deep knowledge of the circumstances of remote communities. His sudden death in 2013 was a great loss for central Australia.</Content>

    <Content>On one of our first visits to Mungalawurru, a small Aboriginal community eighty kilometres northwest of Tennant Creek, a senior man asked if he could use our Toyota Land Cruiser’s high-frequency radio. His relative was in hospital and he wanted to know how the man was faring. The extended family gathered around the car as we made contact. The doctor informed everyone that the patient was awake and recovering, but his leg had been amputated.</Content>

    <Content>That day our radio was the only means by which the residents of Mungalawurru could contact the outside world. The one payphone in the community was out of order – a regular occurrence – and there were no home phones. A few people owned mobile phones, but to make the call, they had to drive along an unsealed road halfway back to Tennant Creek to the old Warrego gold mine, where you can pick up a bar or two of reception on some handsets. There was only one laptop among the twenty-two permanent residents of Mungalawurru, but it wasn’t connected to the internet.</Content>

    <Content> Mungalawurru’s somewhat extreme degree of isolation was about to change. We were doing the groundwork for a project that would provide computers and internet access, along with training and maintenance, to households in three small communities. Kwale Kwale, forty kilometres west of Alice Springs, was the first to be connected, followed Mungalawurru and then Imangara, which lies between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, east of the Stuart Highway.</Content>

    <Content>Aside from finding out which households wanted internet access, we hoped to discover why – despite government programs – people didn’t have it already and whether they saw potential benefits in being online. We weren’t testing new satellite speeds or trying out a new e-health application; we were simply attempting to connect households to the existing, standard satellite broadband, using the most commonly-available equipment. The process of doing this, however, revealed the obvious ways in which the broadband market and government policies were failing to serve remote Aboriginal communities.</Content>

    <Content>This book tells the story of what became known in research circles as the Home Internet Project, or ‘the computer project’ within the communities themselves. The simplicity of those titles belied the bafflingly low rates of internet adoption in these communities. Six in 10 adults in the communities had never used the internet when we made that trip in 2010. A third of those who had used a computer at some point in the past had not used the internet, some having only used computers to play solitaire; others for sharing music. Three quarters of those who had used the internet were under the age of 30.</Content>

    <Content> Fewer than 4 in 10 Indigenous households in remote and very remote Australia had an internet connection at home, compared with over 8 in 10 households of the total Australian population. In some parts of the country the figure was much lower, such as the Barkly region in central Australia (excluding the township of Tennant Creek), where take-up was less than 1 in 10 for Indigenous households. The term ‘digital divide’ describes those who are accessing the benefits of computers and the internet, and those who are not. In Australia, the divide is widest between Aboriginal people living in remote areas and non-Aboriginal people living in the same area.</Content>

    <Content>The purpose of this book is threefold. Firstly, we examine the reasons for the digital divide, looking at the particular circumstances and ways of life within remote communities that have contributed to low rates of household internet adoption, particularly in small communities. We pay particular attention to the cultural and economic systems (both traditional and contemporary) that influence internet adoption and use. Secondly, we seek to demonstrate the ways in which broadband is changing life in remote communities. What are the consequences of digital exclusion, and to what extent can broadband help overcome the hardship and inconveniences of living in remote settlements? Thirdly, the Home Internet Project was established as a trial (see Chapter 1), in that it set out to implement an alternative to current digital divide strategies in remote Australia. Where the insights of this book relate to policy frameworks and industry behaviours, we have attempted to outline those connections and suggest new approaches.</Content>

    <Content>The three communities in this book differ in their size, and in their distance from major towns (Kwale Kwale 40 kilometers; Mungalawarru 80 kilometers; and Imangara 200 kilometers). Between 6 and 18 houses were located on each outstation, although not all houses were habitable the entire time. Occupancy fluctuated, dictated by issues including access to services such as schools, incarceration, wasp nests, broken pipes, housing revitalization programs, visitors and family tragedy. Each community also contained additional structures, such as sheds, that were used for a range of activities including clinic visits, as places of worship, and for enterprise (see Chapter 2). The largest community has around 100 permanent residents, and the smallest only twelve.</Content>

    <Content>It is true to say that outstations are generally very small. However, although defining outstations by size of population is convenient for data collection and bureaucratic processes, it does not adequately convey their purpose or place. Families who choose to live on outstations have a direct ancestral connection to the land. This is distinct from other communities, where people have relocated from different places into administratively identified settlements, either through necessity or coercion. As Jon Altman points out, even this definition tends to create a ‘false dichotomy in settlement hierarchies between larger discrete Indigenous townships and smaller outstations’, when in fact regular movement between townships and outstations ‘is a culturally distinctive feature of the way Aboriginal people live’ (see Chapter 2).</Content>

    <Content> We have chosen to retain the terms adoption and use, partly to emphasize that choices also occur within particular regimes – the retail offerings, infrastructures and programs developed and offered by agencies and businesses that are often separate from, and external to, life in remote communities. The level to which these structures are adaptable or inflexible, and the strategies people develop in order to work around, or away from, such regimes, are important for understanding the digital divide. The various attempts to resolve communication infrastructure in remote Australia also reveal the aspirations and assumptions about how remote communities should exist in relation to the so-called outside world. These mutations of the policy apparatus have been surprisingly disconnected from other attempts to construct, remedy or intervene in the welfare of the Territory’s remote communities (see Chapter 1). This book therefore sits within a media studies tradition of policy analysis, grounded in the observable daily use of information and communications technology (ICT).</Content>

    <Content>Our investigations into internet use revealed a social setting that was embedded within traditional structures, but where those ways of organizing and understanding the world blended into everyday, non-traditional activities. For instance, when we asked about his online contacts, one man told us, ‘I don’t have friends, only family’, referring to a possibly extensive kinship network rather than social isolation. Although we were not privy to the depth of such relationships from our limited position as researchers investigating media, we were given some insights into how communications technologies (internet and mobile phones) are creating new social configurations and placing pressure on customs. Chapter 5 discusses these issues in relation to cyber-safety concerns that arose in the township of Tennant Creek during the course of our work.</Content>

While policy commentators often notice that cultural meetings and funeral business take people away from their outstation base, we observed that rodeos and local show days had the same outcome. To us, such movements between communities and towns were interesting, because they have consequences for how people stay connected, and for their preferences in terms of retail offerings and devices, as discussed in Chapters 8 and 9.</Content>

    <Content>From the start, our interest in home internet was more explorative than developmental. We provided households in the three communities with access to a computer and an internet connection in order to understand why such a common means of internet access was not being taken up by residents. Although we were curious to know whether internet would transform life in the communities, we did not set out to achieve transformation, in the way that ‘ICT for development’ seeks to do (see Chapter 2). Rather, our interest was in how the infrastructures of the internet – including the technologies, public policy programs and retail mechanisms – were serving or failing this particular population. If the residents gave up on their home internet, or decided to do things differently, that would be as revealing as if they embraced the technology outright.</Content>

    <Content>When we commenced the project, we had various hypotheses as to why these outstations had not sought out internet services. One hypothesis was that it was simply a matter of affordability, given the very low income of the households. We also considered practical matters to do with housing such as living arrangements, the condition of the houses, and being home long enough to want a permanent connection to the internet. We were well aware of the physical challenges to infrastructure, with one of our partners, the Centre for Appropriate Technology (CAT), having conducted various surveys and infrastructure projects in the region over the years. However, we did not know how long computers and related electronics could withstand the heat, dust and vermin.</Content>

    <Content>A great deal occurred during those four years, both within the communities and externally. As described in the Chapter 2, we provided free internet connections and maintained computers for two and a half years. Our presence and purpose in the communities changed the dynamics of what home internet meant to these households. CAT dealt with the installers, and replaced and repaired equipment on a regular basis. We all attempted to help residents, showing them how to do certain things, listening to their concerns, and repeatedly explaining how they could maintain a connection of their own in the future. All these efforts meant that when the choice came to take out an internet connection of their own, many households chose to do so.</Content>

    <Content>Beyond these communities, the communications landscape was constantly changing. During our various travels beyond the outstations (comparative work on the project, as well as interactions between the two Indigenous organizations on the project team), we observed that different groups were accessing the internet in different ways. For instance, some were conducting online transactions intermittently at internet kiosks located in caravan parks and council offices. Others were playing computer games while in prison or rehabilitation facilities. Where there were remote media centers or schools, these provided important (although monitored) forms of access. As the years went by, we witnessed more people using mobile phones and tablets when in town, in what seemed to be a sudden spike in mobile device use in the region. We concluded that remote Aboriginal communities have vastly different levels and means of internet access depending on community size, proximity to larger towns or tourist sites, and on the agencies and businesses that interact with them. We have incorporated examples of the various regimes of access, and compared and contrasted these where possible (Chapter 8).</Content>

    <Content>The wide disparities in internet access between different communities sits uncomfortably with Australia’s national broadband agenda. In recent years, debates around inequities in broadband performance have centered on the National Broadband Network (NBN), with a particular focus on regional versus capital city infrastructure and speeds. The NBN is a government-funded wholesale-only broadband network that sells to retail service providers, who in turn sell services to the public. The initial rationale for the NBN was to provide a nation-building infrastructure that could provide fast broadband services to all Australians. A number of aspects of the plan were based on this objective, and satellite internet was incorporated into the NBN, as satellite connections can be received anywhere via domestic satellite receivers. As discussed in Chapter 1, the NBN was also designed with regional parity in mind, insofar as under-serviced areas were the first to receive the infrastructure. The model of a national wholesale infrastructure provider was intended to serve those outside the mainstream areas by providing a wholesale price base that would be consistent as far as possible across the country, rather than being strictly costed at the local level. Pricing was designed to ensure that entry-level prices remain at pre-NBN levels for low-income consumers, providing faster and more reliable service at the same price as ADSL.</Content>

    <Content>We discuss the NBN particularly in relation to the ‘last 3 per cent’ – those households where satellite internet was considered the only economically viable option at the time the NBN plans were conceived, and still is at the time of writing. As the NBN is a wholesale model, residents in remote communities deal with the retail service providers, rather than with NBN Co. These interactions constituted a significant aspect of our research towards the latter part of the project, as residents began to enter into contracts to receive NBN services (via retail service providers) under the Interim Satellite Service. We began to see clearly the reasons why many households in remote communities are not acquiring satellite broadband, and prefer pre-paid mobile in areas where mobile reception is available. Our findings suggest that faster speeds alone, although desirable for services and business in remote Australia, will not encourage residents of remote communities to adopt broadband. We question whether household satellite internet – the government’s response to internet access in remote areas – will meet the needs of remote communities under current policy and consumer arrangements.</Content>

    <Content>Australia’s telecommunications dilemma is commonly discussed as a story of market failure, where services to those within the country’s vast interior are necessarily subsidized by city customers and government programs. The outstation experience, however, reveals a more complex picture. Communications technologies are not necessarily adopted in the way that providers expect they will be. Moreover, what on the surface seems like an individual choice (adoption) can occur as a group dynamic, informed by social factors that may seem far removed from communications policy. When the movement of people within and across communities is taken into account, as well as their economic priorities, social obligations, and capacities within a particular locality, it seems unlikely that the problem of broadband adoption will be resolved through infrastructure alone. However, changes to the way that internet is sold and supported could make a significant difference.</Content>

    <Content>There are good reasons why the potential benefits of the internet need to be considered at this point in time. As the NBN brings with it new services and applications, those who are not connected now will fall further behind as the benefits for others increase. However, while recognizing the rapid transformations that are taking place at various levels of the economy and society as a result of digital technology, we urge caution to those who see broadband as a remedy for remote Australia. Commonly-held aspirations for broadband relating to better service delivery, overcoming remoteness and hardship, and cost savings, reflect a set of external priorities. The agendas of government and NGOs are not necessarily aligned with those of people living in remote communities. Moreover, the expectation that ICTs will provide those living in traditional and remote societies with greater connection to the outside world on their own terms imposes an untested assumption that such engagement is desired in the first place. Regardless of the potential good that may or may not come from this, the personal and socially-specific nature of internet use means that it may never eventuate. And just as there is the potential to provide connectivity in the social world within which these communities operate, so there is potential for it to allow communities to retreat further from the government and NGO services, and from non-Indigenous workers who serve and assist Indigenous people through face-to-face encounters.</Content>

    <Content>During the years when our research took place, outstations became the subject of intense public debate, as discussed in Chapter 2. Outstations have historically been associated with a politics of self-determination, representing the right and choice of Aboriginal people to live on country. The outstation debate has revolved around government funding for the maintenance of outstations, including basic infrastructure such as water and roads: whether these are entitlements of all Australians regardless of where they live, or whether outstations should be considered private land that residents themselves must maintain. The practical considerations of outstation maintenance have taken place against a backdrop of Indigenous policy change, which some have characterized as a shift away from self-determination towards ‘mainstreaming’. The mainstreaming approach posits that relocating residents to larger settlements with services is necessary in order to overcome the poverty and social exclusion experienced in remote communities. In Chapter 1, we outline the history of the outstation movement as well as the particular policy attempts to provide telecommunications services. Although it is the case that broadband may assist Indigenous people to live on their lands by providing access to some services online, without basic infrastructure, such as roads, power and water, the future of outstations is bleak.</Content>

    <Content>Digital divide debates center on whether the market can create equitable outcomes in an information society, and on what types of infrastructure and programs may help to overcome the divide. Two unresolved questions preoccupy digital divide studies. Firstly, statistical studies have drawn a link between social exclusion and digital exclusion, in that those who are least likely to have access to the internet are also least likely to have access to other resources. Does this mean that social exclusion is the cause of digital exclusion? The second concern is whether resolving digital exclusion can assist in overcoming social exclusion. Does access to digital resources enable activities and opportunities that can transform lives in positive ways?</Content>

    <Content>Our research uncovered interesting and unique dimensions and patterns of internet access, which took us some way towards answering these questions. As mentioned above, not all communities experience low rates of adoption, but there are pockets of significant exclusion. When we look more closely at what is occurring in places of higher adoption and those with lower adoption, this unevenness begins to make sense. As discussed in Chapters 8 and 9, we observed a reasonably high rate (over 70 per cent) of mobile broadband adoption in Ali Curung, which has mobile broadband coverage, however, in Imangara when we arrived, where the only available connection was satellite internet, there was no internet adoption. Both communities had a similar socio-economic profile. We also observed that people fell in and out of internet use, sometimes on a regular basis, particularly those whose lives were more mobile (see Chapter 4). This suggests that internet adoption is not a fixed event or a linear trajectory from non-use to advanced use. For many, internet access is desirable, but only when other factors allow for it.</Content>

We argue that the concept of digital choice, while useful, does not entirely describe what is occurring. Digital choice denotes individual decision-making, whereas in this case the social norms of the group were resulting in whole communities choosing not to adopt. Moreover, studies show that people are more likely to adopt technology if others they know are already using it, suggesting that network effects play a significant role.</Content>

    <Content>Where others have discussed digital choices, we go further to examine exactly what kinds of choices are being enacted in remote communities. The choice, in this instance, is one where the choosers set targets for particular characteristics and eliminate products that don’t meet those targets completely (a ‘deal-breaker’ scenario). Many make a decision to use computers and the internet regardless of their socio-economic status, as long as the conditions of internet access suit them. Our trial – providing assistance and maintenance for home internet – changed the dynamics and conditions of satellite internet to the extent that many households chose to move to NBN satellite plans at the conclusion of the project. When available under the right conditions, home internet is entirely possible. In Chapters 8 and 9, we offer suggestions as to how to small communities can be better served.</Content>

    <Content>The second concern of digital divide studies is whether digital inclusion can help overcome other exclusions; for instance, whether it enables people to overcome barriers in education, employment and health. In this book we have attempted to provide an answer, with caveats. We looked at what people used the internet for, and concluded that the internet can enable a level of personal autonomy that is significant for residents of outstations, but that this does not necessarily signify a solution to social disadvantage. However, the applications and services that might assist the particular and extreme disadvantages present in remote communities did not exist in 2010-2014. Therefore, the possibility that broadband might enable a better level of service provision remained untested. Moreover, the elaborate uses required for activities such as enterprise development would require a level of training and assistance beyond the capacity of our project (see discussion on training, Chapter 6).</Content>

    <Content> As we discuss in Chapter 5, residents’ use of computers and the internet was confined to a fairly narrow set of activities: entertainment (downloading music, watching videos), social networking, games, storing photos, shopping and personal administration, including banking and managing welfare payments. Only a few people used email, and generally to receive notices of meetings or visits from external providers (including us). The uses that we observed were clearly a continuation of everyday activities, such as downloading gospel music in one community where interest in Christianity was high, checking welfare payments before making the journey into town, and browsing shopping sites for cars that were being sold cheaper interstate.</Content>

    <Content> Although we touch on the question of cultural destruction in our discussion of cyber-safety concerns (Chapter 5), it is worth stating from the outset that the internet rapidly became just another part of life – a mundane asset tied into routines and habits that brought with it some advantages, as well as some newfound frustrations. As we describe in Chapter 5, internet use is a media practice tied in with typical quests for entertainment, to connect with a friend, or a quick fix for personal administration. The priorities, joys, boredoms and obligations of life in these communities did not shift fundamentally. In Heather Horst’s words, what we observed was ‘humanity’s remarkable capacity to reimpose normativity just as quickly as digital technologies create conditions for change’.</Content>

This book is as much about our own efforts to assist the residents to access the internet under current constraints as it is about the insights the residents of these communities shared with us. At times it was a complicated endeavour, technically and interpersonally. We went to great lengths and great expense along the way. The message of this book, however, is that the digital divide should not be seen as an intractable problem, and that costly solutions may not always be the right approach.

We also describe the residents’ experiences of the internet before we arrived, and the methods we employed to shed light on the dynamics of internet adoption (Chapter 2). Part Two discusses the residents’ encounters with the internet and specific issues, including ownership of devices (Chapter 3); people’s mobility and travel (Chapter 4); gender dynamics (Chapter 7); training needs (Chapter 6); as well as what people used the internet for (Chapter 5). Part Three looks at other scenarios of ICT infrastructure and access in central Australia, including the shared facilities approach that has evolved out of various programs and policies, and mobile internet (Chapter 8). We conclude the book by considering digital choices in relation to the digital divide, as well as the implications for broadband policy (Chapters 9 and Conclusion).</Content>

    <Content>On our way to the Barkly communities, we travelled on the road named after the first European explorer to make the journey from Australia’s south to north coasts, John McDouall Stuart, for which he was paid a commission associated with the establishment of a telegraph line. We passed two heritage telegraph repeater stations, one at our starting point in Alice Springs and the other 280 kilometers north at Barrow Creek. Now tourist destinations, the small stone buildings once housed the equipment and operators that connected Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain. On one particular trip, we asked the bar tender at the Barrow Creek roadhouse how long he had been living there.

    <Content>The everyday life of residents of remote Indigenous communities is unlike that of most Australians in very many ways. Remote communities are small, isolated settlements, separated by great distances. While they offer many rich social and cultural benefits for their residents, they have poor transport connections, little infrastructure and scarce resources. But as it does for other Australians, life in remote communities involves communications: with family members in other places, with social networks, and with governments, organizations, and businesses. Reliable communications for the people who live and work in remote Australia are all the more essential on account of their isolation, and unlike urban Australians, they have never taken these for granted. Despite many positive developments, adequate communications are still not the reality for most Indigenous communities, and the problem of securing them has been a challenging and defining issue from the beginning.</Content>

    <Content>This chapter discusses the policy contexts of the problem. Policy matters because governments have defined, regulated and largely funded the communications sector in remote Australia, and because governments continue to play a paternalistic role, albeit a contested one, in Indigenous citizens’ lives. But these two policy registers – communications and Indigenous affairs – have very different histories, institutional settings and policy languages. Communications has been a core Commonwealth responsibility, and a reasonably important agency, under different guises, since Federation. Despite many large changes in structure and policy, this is a field where the Commonwealth has long been certain of its role. Indigenous Affairs, by contrast, is a much more difficult, arduous and wicked problem, which has involved continuing inter-governmental skirmishes as to the division of responsibilities. Unlike communications, the Commonwealth’s work in Indigenous affairs has failed to find any ongoing institutional location, with successive shifts from a dedicated department to the Indigenous-elected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an element within social services, and most recently an anomalous, operational wing of the Prime Minister’s department. Far from heralding the progress of Indigenous affairs to the center of national public administration, these migrations signal a volatile history of reversals and revisions, where a lack of governmental confidence is reflected above all in the scant regard paid to domain expertise, experience or memory.</Content>

    <Content>If Australian governments have struggled to comprehend the needs and circumstances of remote Australians, this is despite the fact that the geography and social reach of communications has been a common thread in policy and politics since Federation. And if Australia’s distinctive human and physical geographies did not themselves make debates about subsidizing rural and regional services an inevitable feature of policy argument, the political economy of the settlements struck between the new Australian states ensured it would be so. A national government required, in effect, a single market for communications, whether these were postal services, telegraphy, or phone calls. In the case of central Australia, governments, rather than the market, have directly shaped communications from the early colonial period. For our purposes, the key developments are recent. Remote communications assumed a new and urgent shape as a problem of contemporary public policy in the first decade of the millennium, at the same time as broadband communications and the mobile internet were becoming embedded in the everyday lives of mainstream, urban Australians.</Content>

    <Content>Understanding how that happened – and the outcomes for remote communities – involves recognizing two connected processes of policy change that were well underway at this time. First, there was a process of digital transformation, driven not only by technical advances in infrastructure, devices and applications, but, most importantly, by how governments and others responded to new communications technologies. From the 1980s onwards, new communications had undermined confidence in the longstanding model of a government-owned monopoly provider. Then, as mobile and the internet took off, social services, health and community services, education, entertainment, work and commerce began to be redesigned on the assumption that national populations would have access to the necessary infrastructure at an affordable price, and would have the skills and motivations to make use of it. This dynamic had many benefits, while presenting a critical problem, but also an opportunity, for those not online. One effect was to emphasize the increasing relative disadvantage of those Australians without broadband or reliable mobile coverage. While steadily increasing numbers of Australians went online, the question of how to assist and support those without good communications did not diminish in corresponding fashion; instead it grew in importance as a matter for policy and politics.</Content>

    <Content>The second formative change underway over this period was the liberalization of the telecommunications industry, framed by a new, competitive, regulatory model, the incremental sale of Telstra from 1997 onwards, and the subsequent planning and establishment of the NBN. This is not the place for a full review of this history, but we should briefly focus on two turn-of-the-century policy imperatives: the Telstra sale, and the creation of a competitive market for telecommunications. In micro-economic terms, there was no simple relation between these. Paul Keating’s Labor government had been more concerned with fostering competition, particularly through the entry into the market of Optus as a second carrier. The Coalition government led by John Howard prioritized the sale; as it transpired, the effect of that was not more competition, but the consolidation of Telstra’s position as a dominant market player combining control of the infrastructure with a pre-eminent position in retail. This market problem was a key factor in the later development of the National Broadband Network (NBN). At a political and social level, the sale required the support of regionally-based politicians, both within the National Party and outside it. These politicians and their constituencies were motivated by a strong sense of rural and regional disadvantage, and were not naturally inclined to support the disposal of a public enterprise.</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>On the strength of objections from rural and regional interests, legislation to complete the full sale of Telstra failed in the Senate in 1998. A staged approach, a series of regular reviews, funded programs and accommodations were then necessary for the government to proceed with further public offerings of Telstra shares. The sale was therefore a gradual process, but it represented a slow-motion conclusion to a long period of public control over Australia’s chief communications networks, and the commencement of an ongoing and unstable period of regulation, review and subsidy. A proliferation of large and small publicly-funded schemes, generally short-term, were devised to meet the needs of those users who could not be provided for by market forces alone. It is important to note that the question of communications services for Indigenous communities came into focus through this particular optic: the perspective of a larger population of telecommunications users, including consumers, businesses, and public entities, who were captured under the rubric of rural, remote and regional Australia. This positioning gave Indigenous organizations – increasingly capable as sources of policy innovation over this period – a voice and a place at the communications policy table, where the ‘adequacy’ and ‘equitable’ distribution of services was at issue.</Content>

    <Content>The mobilization of diverse interests in ‘regional telecommunications’ did not always translate into well-directed initiatives: the term has always struggled to cohere the wide range of experiences, problems and situations of all those excluded from mainstream urban infrastructure. From the first regional telecommunications inquiry in 2000 to the present, Indigenous voices have had to emphasize the particularity of circumstances in their societies. Submissions consistently argue the need to design and implement programs with community involvement, and with on-the-ground knowledge of the conditions and circumstances. As this book argues, basic categories that have passed largely unconsidered in mainstream communications, such as the role of communities, or the continuity of the household as a stable organization for the consumption of services, have generally demanded far more careful thought when placed in an Indigenous context.</Content>

    <Content>Nevertheless, a patchwork of major and minor initiatives followed from 1997 onwards, many of them in direct response to the now-regular cycle of regional communications reviews. While most estimates in this period considered around 2 per cent of Australians to be living in locations where commercial communications services were not viable, a considerable amount of public funding supported services beyond that roughly-defined group. Several different approaches were at work. For instance, general purpose grants were offered by Networking the Nation (1997-2004), which used $250million in proceeds from the sale of Telstra to support improved telecommunications for regional, rural and remote communities. Customer subsidies, intended to offset the greater cost of services outside the cities, were offered through Broadband Connect (2005), a $900million four-year program then replaced by the Australian Broadband Guarantee (2007-2011), which funded internet service providers to offer a basic broadband service for remote users.</Content>

    <Content>More targeted programs have focussed on remote Indigenous community needs. The Telecommunications Action Plan for Remote Indigenous Communities (TAPRIC) (2002), Backing Indigenous Ability (2007-10) and the successor Indigenous Communications Program (ICP) funded community projects. Much of the funding in these programs was dedicated to the provision of public payphones. According to the 2005-2006 Budget, TAPRIC’s initiatives sought ‘to overcome a number of complex logistical and social factors affecting the provision of basic telephone services in remote Indigenous communities’.</Content>

    <Content> In theory, a USO is a market design mechanism that works to transfer some of the consumer surplus from one group as an implicit subsidy to another group by effectively forcing a monopoly provider to treat them all as a single market, and by prohibiting price discrimination. A core rationale for the USO in Australia is to provide access to telecommunications for those residing outside cities. The result should be that everyone receives the same supply and pays the same price: the USO thus imposes a kind of transfer from urban to remote consumers via a single provider.

It cannot then reflect the evolving needs of communications users, which now extend well beyond basic telephony, or the rollout of new broadband networks that do not rely on Telstra’s copper infrastructure. Voice services are increasingly used through internet applications that are more flexible, and cheaper than the STS, with support for video, messaging and other functions. But internet access is not part of the USO. Mobile cellular services are vital for network access, but neither are these the focus of the USO. Indeed, the failure of the USO model brings into focus one of the central arguments of this book: the need for a more flexible policy framework for ensuring continuing funding for uneconomic services, and which can respond to local community circumstances and preferences.</Content>

    <Content>The election of the Rudd Labor government in 2007 marked a shift away from the cycle of end-user subsidy schemes towards a more ambitious rethinking of Australia’s communications system. The NBN was conceived as a universally-accessible high-speed network that would ensure Australia’s place in the future ‘digital economy’. It was intended as a general solution to regional and remote disadvantage, through a uniform pricing structure and advanced satellite and fixed wireless services for those households and premises beyond the reach of viable fibre infrastructure. But the network also embodied a micro-economic reform agenda, with NBN’s neutral wholesale role taking over from Telstra’s compromised position in the market, and a service design that would encourage and enable a more diverse range of large and small retailers.</Content>

The ISS was rapidly fully subscribed, and attracted considerable criticism in the 2011 and 2015 regional telecommunications reviews.

    <Content>While the NBN will provide a more capable source for the internet on the outstation, it has long been clear that there cannot be any single infrastructure ‘fix’ for the digital divide in remote Australia. The ICP was intended to be a targeted supply and maintenance program for fixed community phones, mobile satellite phones for very small communities (oddly not covered by the USO), and equipment and training for internet access. The program evolved in interesting ways, reflecting the evolution of communications in the bush from basic telephony to the broader range of internet-enabled services, and from simple shared facilities, such as payphones, to a more varied ecology of mobile devices. So while the ICP began with a focus on payphones, over its course we can see this infrastructure being re-conceptualized as general-purpose internet access points, offering not only a phone but also a wireless access point which could then be shared, with mobile devices, across a group of users. The development and installation of the phones, managed for the Department of Communications by Australian Private Networks (2014), is a remarkable story of ingenuity, opportunism and resourcefulness. The addition of the Wi-Fi capability to the community phone was first trialed at the Laura Dance Festival on Cape York in June 2011, and proved instantly popular. The festival organizer reported later that she could not have run the festival without the Wi-Fi.</Content>

    <Content>As part of Labor’s ‘Closing the Gap’ strategy to redress Indigenous disadvantage, internet access was also provided through a Commonwealth funding agreement with the states and territories, the Remote Indigenous Public Internet Access (RIPIA) National Partnership Agreement. In the Northern Territory, the RIPIA contract was awarded to Northern Territory Libraries. RIPIA reflected the broader social policy agenda of Closing the Gap, and signaled a more developed and far-reaching set of concerns than the earlier emphasis on ‘adequate’ communications and ‘equitable’ access. These new goals appear to reflect the more ambitious aspirations of the early NBN period. Better internet access was understood explicitly in terms of building economic and social capital in communities. The objectives were to reduce barriers to services, increase digital literacy and social inclusion, and economic, social and political participation. It followed from this broad vision of the benefits of the internet that, as well as establishing services, maintenance and training would also be supported. This expansive agenda cut in two ways. The social dimensions of internet access were also reflected in a requirement that filtering mechanisms be in place for ‘illegal and offensive materials’. These provisions could well have ameliorated community concerns about internet access; they also echoed the more draconian and paternalistic tenor of those restrictions on computer use that had been imposed under the Howard government Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER; ‘the Intervention’). However, the RIPIA project was limited in what it could reasonably achieve. Northern Territory Libraries set out to provide access and training in forty sites (the majority in the Top End, not the central desert region), receiving only $6,000 per annum per site for equipment, and a similar amount for training (Broadband for the Bush Alliance, 2013). The program was therefore not able to cater for small communities during the period we are concerned with. In 2015 the national RIPIA program funding was redirected into the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, amounting to $2.2million to provide ‘essential infrastructure such as computers, printers and internet access points to improve internet literacy and educational outcomes for children and adults in around seventy-five remote communities’, and administered through a competitive grants-based process.</Content>

From this we gathered basic information, including whether centers existed, whether they were in continuous use, the number of hours they were open, how the centers were funded, user charges, internet speeds and download quotas, as well as supervision arrangements. We also asked survey respondents to provide anecdotal comment on the level and use of activities that occurred in those sites.

    <Content>While policy reviews have raised the profile of this issue, their frequency has encouraged a degree of policy churn. The reviews play a useful ‘monitory’ function, holding governments and commercial parties accountable. But they have also created a start-stop dynamic, and fostered an environment where the longer-term research and evaluation problems have been put to one side, while increasingly familiar advocacy – from one sector or another – takes its place. Every review notes the need for more research, but surprizingly little has been done. A better approach, as the 2015 RTIRC suggests, would be to develop a more robust set of indicators, especially regarding the spatial distribution of facilities and services, and a more ambitious research program, aiming for a systematic understanding of the patterns and dynamics of take-up and use.</Content>

    <Content>A feature of the governmental landscape around remote communities are the discontinuities within and between different regulatory and policy positions. There has been no ready trade in concepts, ideas or objectives between communications policies on the one hand, and Indigenous affairs on the other. While the NBN promised to provide high-speed internet to Australians everywhere, other elements of government concentrated service delivery into larger towns. While public funds were being invested in encouraging computer skills, broadly-framed restrictions were being implemented that controlled the use of computers (in particular, restrictions under the NTER during the 2007-2011 period). At the beginning of this chapter, we spoke of the two registers of policy: a communications approach, framed around ‘adequacy’ and equity of access to services, and a more paternalistic Indigenous policy approach with an emphasis on welfare and control. This simple contrast certainly overlooks the diverse motivations and practices of government in remote Australia. But it also prepares us for starkly different approaches and orientations from different policy domains.</Content>

    <Content>In terms of access to services, Aboriginal communities have a particular character and plight in comparison with other localities with the same remoteness status, due to the historical circumstances of their formation. The larger Aboriginal communities, and some smaller ones that predated the outstation movement, were not created as self-sustaining towns, but were formed from Christian missions and ration stations under policies to encourage centralization, forced sedentariness and assimilation.</Content>

    <Content>For instance, a senior woman at Imangara spoke to us of growing up at Hatches Creek before the outstation was established. Her memories were prompted by printouts from a website that someone at the Central Land Council (CLC) had given her, which included an oral history by Joan Deans, wife of the policeman who was based at the waterhole near Hatches Creek. From 1913 until sometime in the 1970s, Hatches Creek was a mining settlement, producing wolframite, a mineral used in the manufacture of ammunition for the first and second world wars. She explained to us that Warlpiri camped on one side of the waterhole and Alyawarr on the other. They also worked in the mines, presumably alongside the Chinese indentured workers mentioned on the website, and received rations. In a separate conversation she mentioned that when she was a kid ‘everyone was working’, and they had to wait in line to receive tea, brown sugar and flour. Hatches Creek shrank to fewer than a dozen people after the mines closed down, while other such communities grew into sizeable townships.</Content>

    <Content> A landmark development came in 1976 when the Fraser government passed the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act, which provided a legal mechanism for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to reclaim their ancestral lands, including direct transfer of missions and reserves to Aboriginal freehold land, and the ability to fight for land that currently wasn’t already claimed. Further development of outstations occurred through the Community Development Employment Program (CDEP), a subsidized community employment program, from the late 1980s. Funding for housing came later during the late 1980s and in the 1990s through ATSIC when people could prove their willingness to live remotely.</Content>

    <Content>The Aboriginal Land Rights Act returned large areas of lands to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, although it only allowed ability to claim unoccupied land. Half of the land mass in the Northern Territory is now owned by Aboriginal people. The majority of outstations are on Aboriginal land, although some are on excisions from pastoral leases (known as Community Living Areas, CLA) or in national parks. The outstations on CLAs form a critical part of the outstations, or homelands, footprint, signalling how some groups remained connected to their lands, despite appropriation of land by pastoralists.</Content>

    <Content>Outstations are thus settlements where the residents have a descent-based affiliation, and recognized ownership over the land. People returned to country in order to maintain traditional sites, to fulfil their cultural obligations to manage land, and in some cases to avoid political marginalisation in the larger settlements where the artificial collocation of diverse groups had resulted in significant stresses for those who were not traditional owners or who were descendants of the minority language group. As time progressed, outstations also had the appeal of being removed from the social problems of larger settlements, such as alcohol and violence.</Content>

    <Content>Hughes’ and Johns’ ideas are likely to have been influential in the policy shift away from supporting outstations and small communities towards a focus on larger Indigenous communities, known as ‘priority communities’ by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), or ‘Growth Towns’ in the Northern Territory. COAG’s National Partnership Agreements saw new funding directed to ‘priority towns’, with both government policies aiming to support a limited number of communities with additional funding resources to the point where facilities would be comparable with those in equivalent-sized regional towns. While the Commonwealth and Northern Territory government groups were not identical, there was a high degree of overlap, with a total of twenty communities targeted in the Northern Territory, all of which had a population upward of 300. The decision not to direct the new funding to smaller communities and outstations was that the transport links between the ‘hub’ target towns and the smaller communities in their sphere of influence would be upgraded, with a view to encouraging and assisting residents of these smaller communities to utilize the hub services.</Content>

    <Content>New houses were built on the proviso that the prioritized communities signed a lease, ensuring that the Commonwealth had responsibilities for housing in Aboriginal communities. The lease arrangements were part of government’s secure tenure policy, and allowed all community houses to choose to transfer to a public housing model. Meanwhile, other remote Indigenous Communities not classified as priority/growth towns or outstations continued to receive funding targeted towards specific services such as local government municipal services (power, water, waste management, roads), health clinics, schools, and police stations. They would also later be asked for a lease, so that their houses could be renovated, upgraded or rebuilt (for houses deemed inhabitable</Content>

The community houses and shed in Kwale Kwale are serviced by mains power and water supply from Power and Water, except for one outlying house in the settlement with solar power.

To receive power, residents need to purchase a power card from a store and insert it into a meter. They were thus very aware of their power usage, telling us that they were conscious not to use too many appliances. Some were concerned that having a computer would significantly increase their power costs. As it turned out, power became more of an issue when computers were located in shared spaces, as people did not necessarily contribute to purchasing ongoing power cards for these buildings.</Content>

    <Content>Imangara is a CLA located on the Murray Downs pastoral station. When land rights were granted, those whose country was being used by others for agricultural purposes were left out. CLAs were designed to overcome that by excising land from pastoral leases so that the traditional owners might live there. The Imangara excision was granted in 1979 in recognition of the close ties that a number of Alyawarr families have with the surrounding country. The fenced living area is 84.72 hectares, located 2 kilometers east of Murray Downs homestead. Over the years that we visited, Imangara cycled through hard times and good times. Dwellings were abandoned, and then later some old houses were repaired and new ones built. Grasses would grow dangerously high at times, and be susceptible to fires. Personal tragedies gutted what had seemed a cohesive township, followed by what seemed a spike in religious activities such as gospel music and church services.</Content>

The land trust was established in the 1980s. To the south of Mungalawurru is Karlantijpa South ALT, west is Central Desert ALT, and to the east Phillip Creek pastoral station and the old Warrego gold mine site. Mungalawurru lies on a flat plain in spinifex country. A few trees have been planted for shelter at one end of the community, but otherwise the outstation is exposed to high winds and hot sun. At times, blue-green puddles appeared on the road into Mungalawurru, formed from sulphur used to neutralize cyanide from the tailings dam. The road into the community is bitumen for two-thirds of the drive, but the last third regularly became inaccessible in the rain. We were forced to turn back on occasion, and the residents told us of having to walk that 30 kilometers to the bitumen when they got cut off.</Content>

    <Content>Indigenous social policy and communications policy have particular histories and objectives, and have at times been contradictory in their treatment of remoteness, including the viability of remote living, and government’s responsibility to provide infrastructure to all Australians. As the Australian Commonwealth moves towards a ‘digital by default’ strategy of service provision, the issue of how those living in remote Australia will access services online becomes more critical. In the next chapter, we take a closer look at the notion of the digital divide and discuss the practical aspects of bringing internet to the outstations.</Content>

    <Content>When we first visited the three outstations, only one house out of twenty-four had an internet connection. A man at Kwale Kwale who was living on the community with the permission of the traditional owners had figured out that he could receive a tolerable mobile broadband signal 40 kilometers from Alice Springs by taping a 3G stick modem to a pole on his roof, connected to his computer by a long ethernet cable. His house was located a kilometer from the main cluster of houses, and his solution had gone unnoticed by others at Kwale Kwale, as he did not interact much with the family. Four years later, fifteen households in the three communities had home internet connections, received via domestic satellite dishes planted on the rooves of their houses. The residents were paying for the internet through a retail service provider under standard contracts. We had assisted them to sign up for the services, but the decision to acquire the services was entirely their own.</Content>

    <Content>This chapter describes the decisions and steps that led to residents accessing the internet at the outstations, and how these efforts fitted within our research approach. We discuss the reasons for using a trial approach to understanding a digital divide problem, and how the process of providing computers and internet enabled us to test some policy assumptions around the most effective or most culturally-appropriate forms of access. Although on the surface our approach resembles previous studies that have occurred in the area of information and communications technology (ICT) for development, we explain how our motivations and actions differed somewhat from that particular field of research. In the second half of the chapter, we provide a plain-language account of some of the technical components of the project.</Content>

    <Content>The digital divide was first used as a measure of how the ‘Information Society’ was progressing within and between nation states. Countries began to measure computer and internet ownership as an indicator of knowledge economy growth and competitive advantage. These exhaustive statistical studies were based on a tradition of work on telephone penetration, such as that developed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the United States, and the emphasis on hardware and network reach was carried over to the analysis of the social distribution of the internet. The NTIA positioned the digital divide as physical access to computers by measuring the number of households and individuals with a computer and internet connection, and in 2002 declared the divide was largely overcome—‘we are truly a nation online’—with the internet being used at work, schools, and libraries as well as at home by over half of the American population, and rising by two million new users a month.</Content>

          <Content>Peculiarities in the data relating to the type of internet connection are likely to have been the result of the way in which the survey was administered. The census is completed in remote communities with the assistance of ABS staff, who administer the survey door-to-door, whereas elsewhere it is completed by household members either online or on paper. The census asked residents what type of internet connection was available at the dwelling. The options included ‘broadband’, ‘dial-up’ and ‘other’, with an explanatory note that ‘other’ includes ‘internet access through mobile phones etc’. However, in Santa Teresa, a community with mobile coverage, no dwellings were identified as having an ‘other’ internet connection, while thirty houses chose ‘not stated’. In Yuendumu, twenty-seven houses stated that they had an ‘other’ connection and only three were not stated. There are a number of possible explanations for these inconsistencies, including whether the question was adequately explained to the participant, as well as confusion as to whether individual access to the internet via a mobile device is considered to belong to a dwelling or not. Despite these discrepancies, when grouped into ILOCs with mobile coverage and those without, the differences in internet adoption appear to be statistically significant.</Content>

    <Content>In attempting to research the digital divide in remote Aboriginal communities, we were presented with some unique challenges. Many people in remote communities had never used the internet when we commenced (including the majority of adults in the three communities). While other studies have moved on from basic questions of use versus non-use, this was clearly still important to our research. Moreover, although most countries possess longitudinal data on internet adoption and use that enable statisticians to draw correlations between internet access and other forms of social inclusion, as explained below, remote Indigenous populations have been left out of many Australian data sets. We also had serious doubts as to whether the questions being asked of other population groups would tell us much about the dynamics of the digital divide in remote Australia, given that unique factors were in play, including cultural norms, extreme environmental conditions, and a different range of opportunities. Therefore, although we undertook a standard line of questioning around people’s online engagement, their attitudes towards technologies and their skills, we set out to examine these in relation to daily life in remote communities.</Content>

There is also no current data on ICT infrastructures in remote communities, which prevented us from providing an in-depth analysis of adoption in relation to different kinds of internet programs and services nationwide (see Chapter 9 for an analysis of mobile adoption in the central Australia region). Although ICT infrastructure was included in the Community Housing and Infrastructure Needs Survey (CHINS), the last CHINS collection occurred in 2006, and the survey has since been discontinued.</Content>

    <Content>As so little research had been conducted on internet adoption and use in central Australia, we were conscious that measures typically used to gauge ‘high versus low order’ internet use would not necessarily apply. Determining whether the internet was used for job searches, for instance, says little about digital inclusion when there are no jobs nearby (or where employers are not using the internet to promote those jobs that are available). Understanding the tangible outcomes of internet use thus required significant engagement with communities to understand their particular circumstances and priorities, which we undertook across a four-year time-frame. As Correa and Pavez note in their study of first encounters with the internet in remote (non-Indigenous) communities in Chile, ‘geographic isolation makes the social context more decisive in any action or decision’, and digital inclusion is a process that involves ‘multiple dimensions such as technological access, skills, different uses, social contexts and support’.</Content>

    <Content> We found that particular deprivations can be difficult to understand when encountering individuals in remote communities when no background information is available. For instance, on an early visit, we asked a man if he was living in the community, and whether he was interested in having the internet in his house. He replied that he did not have a house and was living in the ‘windbreak’ – a makeshift shelter of branches and found objects in someone else’s yard. Whether the man was permanently living an itinerant lifestyle – having fallen through the cracks of welfare and housing – or whether his circumstances were the result of the ‘temporary mobility’ discussed in Chapter 4, changes the meaning, duration and consequences of what we might consider to be a hardship. Putting up with inadequate shelter because of a willing decision to visit relatives is different to not being able to afford accommodation, or being excluded from a public housing register. As Sen writes, ‘The issue, ultimately, is what freedom does a person have – everything considered. It should come as no surprise that a person’s deprivation can have diverse origins and may take disparate forms’.</Content>

    <Content>Neither can standard statistical approaches tell us about the effectiveness of particular interventions. A different approach to digital divide studies has been to provide ICT infrastructure where there is none, and to measure the outcomes. The benefit of trials is that they can produce insights into how a technology or system fares within a social context. The small-scale intervention that we designed was intended to examine a specific policy position, in that shared internet facilities were presumed to be the most viable and appropriate, and yet there was no evidence to support one form of internet access over another (see Chapter 1). Moreover, only communities with a population of over 300 people were eligible to apply for funding for shared facilities at the time. By implementing our alternative policy approach, we set out to understand whether shared facilities were the most desirable and practical solution, and what might work in their absence. If personal ownership and acquisition were possible, then understanding what level of assistance and maintenance (if any) was necessary could assist Indigenous organizations to develop their own programs.</Content>

The case studies proved important in that they enabled us to compare home satellite internet with other infrastructures. In the third phase, from the end of 2013, we assisted the households to set up internet services (where desired), and documented the transition. Participants were given the choice to maintain internet access by paying for their own plans under a government-subsidized program, the National Broadband Network (NBN) Interim Satellite Solution (ISS). We continued to visit the communities in 2014 in order to understand how the households were faring with their own internet services. That final stage of the research, where households decided whether to transition to the NBN and to maintain their own services, was revealing, providing important insights into how the government’s solution to providing internet to remote areas was failing this particular group (see part III).</Content>

    <Content>Much of our time during our research visits was spent traipsing from house to house, checking up on the computers, providing people with fresh paper, inks and accessories, as well as responding to requests for on-the-spot training in ICT skills and applications. We became the technical help – the IT support – performing mundane tasks to remove a frustration and return things to normality. Those of us who were less IT proficient were asked to help set up accounts, but we also learnt to blow the red dust off a circuit board, and check for first principles (cords plugged in, power supply on). These ad hoc house visits were as informative for us as they were for the residents, giving us a snapshot of how different individuals were learning how to use the computer, how they maintained the computer, and what these factors might say about the relative value of ICTs in the outstations.</Content>

    <Content>Our research approach thus involved a degree of ethnographic observation, but accrued through short visits of a day or two duration every six weeks or so in each community. CAT and CLC had a great deal of background knowledge of the families and communities, and received information through their extensive networks of events that occurred during the trial period. Such information was useful in helping us to avoid intruding on the communities during difficult or inconvenient times, although sometimes our information networks failed us (the worst example being when we showed up the same day a coffin was delivered). The following chapters draw on such information, but this book should not be taken as a full anthropological account of these communities; nor do we think such an approach was necessary. As the project progressed, we became increasingly aware that a less-intrusive approach was sufficient, and perhaps preferable, for understanding the digital divide, partly as it was easiest to discuss computers in our roles as helpers.</Content>

These projects are based on the rationale that communications technology is integral to social and material advancement in order to facilitate the exchange of ideas in a well-functioning society, and to overcome inequities in access to information. Development communications has been widely critiqued for overlooking the inherently social aspects of communication technology, and for assuming that technical and administrative solutions can overcome structural and political inequalities.</Content>

In the years preceding our project, CAT had been directly involved in government community ICT initiatives, including the development and implementation of an alternative community phone project that provided over 250 pay phones to remote communities. The phone operated with pre-paid cards, and was built from the electronic components of readily-available domestic Telstra phones to enable cheap and easy replacement, encased in a stainless steel shell that protected it from damage.</Content>

    <Content>Government agencies that serve remote communities are not necessarily incentivized to commit to small-scale initiatives, particularly trials where the outcome is unknown (the APN community phones WiFi project being an exception). The history of communications in remote Indigenous Australia reflects this, whereby many innovations have occurred ‘pre-policy’ and in an ad hoc fashion through the efforts of the Indigenous sector, including broadcast infrastructure, screen and radio production, high-frequency (two-way) radio networks, satellite television and videoconferencing. Indigenous-owned organizations, together with local leaders, have carried out these experiments, aided (and in some cases generated) by non-Indigenous workers from the education and media sectors. The enterprises and infrastructures of remote media and communication have thus arisen from two cultural traditions operating together within the one settler state.</Content>

    <Content>What was the nature of internet access when we began? There were six computers to be found across the three communities when we started, including the one house with an internet connection mentioned at the opening of this chapter. Not all of the computers belonged to those residing in the communities – at least two were on loan or gifted from people outside of the community. In our early conversations with forty-eight of the residents (about 50 per cent of the adult population of the three communities combined), we learnt that over half had used a computer at some point in the past. However, only two-thirds of those who had used a computer had also used the internet, and three-quarters of internet uses were aged 30 or under. Those in the 30-45 age bracket were most likely to have used a computer, but not the internet.</Content>

A third of mobile owners were aware of, or using, their mobile for internet access – mostly for music downloads and/or chat – which amounted to 10 per cent of everyone we spoke to. One woman had accessed the internet on a mobile phone, but had never accessed the internet from a computer. She was to become one of the most frequent users of the internet.</Content>

    <Content> As the few individuals who owned a computer, or had owned one in the past, were conscious of who they allowed to use the computer, these computers were not necessarily available to others. One young man kept his laptop locked away when he was not using it. Having only a small number of computers in a community also created annoyances for owners, mostly from others who wanted ‘to put songs on their mp3 players’. A woman who owned a laptop was protective of it, telling us that ‘people want to use it but I tell them no because they might spoil it’. These conversations suggested that there was not a critical mass of computers in the community for everyone to experience computer use, and those that did exist were coveted possessions. In the following chapter we explore how these dynamics of ownership changed after the computers arrived.</Content>

Out of the three communities, only two homes had active telephone lines, both in the same community (Kwale Kwale), and both in the homes of older people. One of these phones had restrictions on it; they could receive calls but could not make any charged calls, except by using a pre-paid phone card. Both phones were initially installed to enable contact with medical services. Imangara and Mungalawurru both had a single public payphone in an outdoor cabinet. The distance to houses at the other end of the community was up to 400 metres. Three older people in Imangara expressed a desire for a home telephone: ‘[We] would like telephones. The one here breaks a lot. I need a phone to ring family and friends in other places’, an older woman told us. The older residents had limited knowledge of what services they were entitled to, or what was available for purchase. When asked how they would go about getting a telephone, none was able to provide a straightforward answer. One woman said she didn’t have a home phone because she ‘hadn’t been given one’. Others said they would contact the council in the first instance, rather than a telecommunications company. The elders in Imangara said that they would like at least one public phone for each cluster of houses (‘camp’), as it was too far to get to the telephone if someone was calling.</Content>

    <Content>The attitude of waiting for external authorities to provide telephones is unsurprising, given the way in which Australia’s USO has been delivered, whereby consumers are entitled to services but must cover the cabling costs themselves – costs that are beyond households or even whole communities (Chapter 1). Satellite internet, however, was heavily subsidized at the time, including installation costs. That households had not sought out satellite internet, despite this being far more affordable than home telephones, seemed peculiar to us – until we began the process of installing satellite internet ourselves.</Content>

    <Content>Although the ABG scheme subsidized provision of satellite broadband to remote areas, connecting computers to these services was not straightforward, but involved a long sequence of steps. Customers had to determine via an online map which registered ISPs operated in their area (or call the government department if internet access was not possible – a likely scenario); register their details online; confirm their permanent residency and the permanency of the building itself; contact one or more of the ISPs to obtain and compare service offerings; and forward the signed declaration form and their contract application to apply for the service. For customers in very remote areas, the ISP would then typically apply to the government department for approval for an additional subsidy. Assuming the customer had arranged for a continuous 240-volt power supply, installation could then commence (notwithstanding what could be several changes to the installation schedule due to weather conditions affecting roads). Once the service was installed, normal billing processes would ensue.</Content>

However, the process can be particularly trying for remote community residents who do not meet all these criteria, and whose only external communications option is a single payphone. Organizing the connections from the relative convenience and comfort of CAT’s Alice Springs office took co-author Andrew thirty phone calls.

    <Content>The computer equipment supplier visited the communities with CAT to get an idea of their layout and the dimensions and conditions of the buildings, in order to design arrangements for the WiFi directional antenna equipment. A separate company from Mt Isa, a sub-contractor to the ISP, installed the internet satellite facilities the following month with CAT’s assistance. Each installation only took several hours; the sub-contractor’s visits to Mungalawarru and Imangara formed only one stop on their three-week timetable, covering about 10,000km and traversing western Queensland, northern South Australia and central and southern Northern Territory. We decided that point-to-multipoint wireless was a more cost-effective choice for connecting the computers to the satellite internet services, because installing cable would also have involved digging trenches between all the houses. Additionally, if a house was rebuilt or added (and housing works did occur at Imangara in the last year of the project), more cabling and trenches would be needed.</Content>

    <Content>We began the installation process at Kwale Kwale, because it was closest to Alice Springs (where CAT, the partner most involved in this stage, was located), and therefore easier to roadtest the process and any issues that might arise. We chose the large shed near the community’s central core of three houses for the satellite dish and service, because it had mains power, allowed direct connection to two of the four new computers, and had a better (though not ideal) line of sight profile to the other two houses for local WiFi radio connection. Locating the dish in the shed later proved to be a problem, as it required that the community maintain a power supply to the equipment by replenishing pre-paid power cards as needed. Although households were prepared to do this when the dish was co-located with other household appliances, the same commitment did not stretch to a shared space, and the connection would fail due to lack of power.</Content>

    <Content>At Imangara, we had two satellite services installed, so that the level of internet capacity at this larger community would be similar to that available at the two smaller outstations. Originally, two senior residents agreed to be the custodians for these services, so the dishes were to be placed on their respective houses. However, one decided to move to Tennant Creek to support his grandchildren, who were attending school there, and the service intended for his house was moved instead to the Women’s Centre, the other most viable option. This change of arrangements took some time to confirm with the ABG staff, and was only approved a short time before the installers visited the community. The degree of mobility amongst remote-community people and the amount of time this change took to process with the ABG group was early evidence of the difficulties associated with subsidized satellite internet programs in remote communities. Movement between houses, and to and from community, was to become a significant factor that influenced people’s access to the internet. As recounted in Part III, issues with providers persisted when the households moved to the NBN interim satellite service scheme in 2013.</Content>

    <Content>The second level of infrastructure concerns involved whether the households might want laptops or desktops, a decision that we believed might be important in terms of residents’ mobility. On an early visit to Imangara, we found a discarded laptop on the back of a trailer, which was missing a keyboard. After observing this, we pointed out to the residents that desktop computers were tougher, the screens and keyboards were larger and easier to use, that desktop computers were also more likely to stay in one place, and that the individual parts (keyboard, monitor, mouse) could be replaced. Laptops, we said, were a good idea if they expected to be moving to and from their community on a regular basis. After weighing up the information we gave them, most community members chose desktop computers rather than laptops. Along with computers, we supplied printers, inks and paper, and accessories such as mice, cables, headsets, speakers, keyboards, power boards and spare monitors. People wanted to be able to print pictures and photos in color from the computers, so we provided gel-based, inkjet color printers, because they were cheaper at an entry level and at cost of printing per sheet, and the ink was less likely than conventional inkjet printers to dry out in extreme desert temperatures .</Content>

Initially, people at the communities weren’t sure whether they wanted individual computers in their houses, or whether to share terminals. At Imangara, some senior women felt the equipment would be safer in the only community building available, the Women’s Centre. But by our next trip, most households preferred to have their own computer. We put two more computers in the Women’s Centre, in any case, for any residents who didn’t have computers in their homes, and for use by the couple running the Women’s Centre.

Cultural factors to do with communal sharing, mobility and ownership were also raised as likely obstacles to home computing, meaning the computers would be given away or taken out of the homes permanently. A station owner told us it was a ‘hare-brained idea’ that would give community members another reason ‘to sit at home and do nothing’. Essentially, the fact that very few households had purchased computers and entered into internet subscriptions of their own accord was seen as proof that home internet was, at best, not the preferred means of access, and at worst, either inappropriate or unviable.</Content>

After the first few months of the project, computer tables were rarely locked and items often disappeared, especially power boards and external speakers, which could be used with other household equipment. Not surprisingly, printers were the equipment to break down most frequently, in some cases irreparably so, with an estimated service lifetime of about two years in these communities. The build-up of dust and grit inside printers, often caused by residents leaving the cover off the paper feed, was a particular source of malfunction. We took one broken printer back to Alice Springs to determine whether it could be rescued, only to find a perfectly formed mouse nest made of shredded paper nestled inside.

In this chapter, we discuss how traditional and Western systems of ownership played out during the home internet trial, and draw on anthropological literature to contend that different values are placed on different kinds of objects. Computer ownership was more likely to occur at the household level, while difficulties arose in relation to shared computers (see Chapter 9 for a case study of a shared computer facility in Papunya). The related issue of how training is best provided is examined in detail in Chapter 6.</Content>

    <Content>The system of demand sharing, a mechanism for the distribution of goods and services, plays an important role in maintaining socio-economic relationships amongst remote Aboriginal people. This form of exchange is said to have foundations in traditional lifestyle, when sharing was a matter of survival in a situation of scarcity and unpredictable food supply. Today, demand sharing fulfils social obligations, and acts as a levelling mechanism, whereby those with more resources give, when asked, to those with less. The considered way in which this occurs can be described as a ‘calculus of reciprocity’.</Content>

    <Content>, is the key to understanding how demand sharing functions. In attempting to establish a critical mass of household computer users in the three communities, we sought to understand what implications the demand sharing system might have for ICT provision in remote Aboriginal Australia. We were aware, for example, that the computers would be subject to types of ownership within the demand sharing system that would be more influential than the Western form of legal ownership we invited participants to take up. We hoped to gain some insights into the interplay between both systems of ownership, and what lessons these might have for ICT policy development and provision in remote Aboriginal contexts.</Content>

    <Content>Previous ethnographic research has documented different types of ownership and associated rights and obligations in relation to different objects, including public and private forms, which operate within demand sharing processes in Aboriginal society. The literature makes a significant distinction between ownership and usage: while an item might be ‘owned’ by an individual, this does not necessarily equate to exclusive or any usage by that same individual. However, the onus is on a person to ask for use of an object, and giving in response to a legitimate demand fulfils a social obligation. Not only does the practice of demand sharing redistribute resources, but various social alliances and networks are created and maintained in the process, while the autonomy of the giver is acknowledged. In this way, demand sharing is integral to the tension between relatedness and individual autonomy that underpins all Aboriginal social practices.</Content>

    <Content>At the start of the project, the few individuals who had laptops told us that they would hide them from others to keep them safe. When the desktop computers arrived, some community members managed the dynamic between autonomy and relatedness through their use of padlocks and passwords to regulate others’ access to the household computers. Virtually all residents with desktop computers said that visitors to their community had used their computers at one time or another, often without permission while they were away. Often this involved people cutting off the padlocks on the computer covers or prising off the hasp. Some found this highly annoying, and took steps to limit access to their computer when they were out of the community, either through passwording, and/or by locking the desk cover, and/or by having an individual room or house where the computer was kept. One woman took the computer cords with her when she travelled. Mostly houses were not locked, even when people went away.</Content>

    <Content>Once some participants had obtained individual internet accounts and were paying for the internet themselves, we gained the impression that asking permission to use the computers became more common, and that usage became more restricted to the individual household/family (almost two-thirds at this point told us that people had asked to use their computers). One woman at Imangara said she only allowed non-household/family members to use her computer in exceptional circumstances: for example, when people needed to contact relatives about arranging funerals, and had run out of money for a phone card, she would allow them to contact relatives via Facebook on her computer. A woman from Mungalawurru told us that some residents from other households had asked her if she could leave the computer cabinet open while she was in Tennant Creek so they could use it, but that she’d started closing the cabinet because ‘they were using it too much’, and we observed that it was closed and padlocked. There seemed to be greater awareness that the owner was paying for internet access, and this impacted on the social dynamics and decision-making surrounding requests and permission to use the computers.</Content>

    <Content>Likewise, the use of passwords became a way of managing others’ – especially visitors’, and to a lesser extent, kids’ – access to the computers. Initially, few residents set passwords on their computers, probably because of the inconvenience of having to remember and enter a password, coupled with a limited understanding of computer and internet safety and security generally. But, as the project progressed, more people began asking us for assistance to set a password, usually in the context of managing others’ usage, as well as preventing unauthorized access when they were away from the community. One woman, for example, requested we set a password on her computer to ‘stop visitors using it and using up all the power’, while another asked for a password for her computer so she could ‘stop people using it’ while she had visitors staying in her house; she started changing the password when too many people had access. A resident reported that someone had cut the padlock off her computer. and consequently she wanted a new and better password. By the end of April 2014, passwords had been established on 65 per cent of computers.</Content>

    <Content> By contrast, the ownership of consumable and moveable items – such as computers and television sets – is subject to demand sharing, and is not thought of as an inalienable right, although personal ownership of equipment is recognized. As well as the purpose for which they were designed or manufactured, objects may play a role within the processes through which social relationships are structured, mediated, tested and re-shaped.

    <Content>Nuances of different kinds of Aboriginal ownership became evident in the ways that certain individuals tested others’ ownership of some computers in the project communities. The computers became objects through which relationships were negotiated within the system of demand sharing in each community. These relationships were not necessarily limited to those within the individual household. They also affected the dynamics surrounding computers within shared spaces, such as the Women’s Centre at Imangara and the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Shed at Mungalawarru. Although most of the computers were installed within individual households, the dynamics surrounding the computers in shared spaces were illuminating, suggesting different forms of Aboriginal ownership at work in these communities, with implications for how to provide equitable access to ICT access.</Content>

At the time, we didn’t have enough funding to buy more desktop computers, so we suggested that her grandchildren use the computers at the Women’s Centre. She responded that it ‘was too far [away] to walk [to]’, which seemed rather unlikely, given that her house was only 200 metres from the Centre.

    <Content> This observation is particularly relevant here, given that Western legal ownership of the computers initially remained with an organization – the Centre for Appropriate Technology (CAT) – prior to being transferred to individual participants. Similarly, Fogarty found, while based at Maningrida, that the school vehicle (a 4WD troop carrier) was not usually the focus of the sort of conflict embedded in ownership of private or community vehicle use, because it was seen as being owned by ‘government’, an entity not part of the local social organization. This did not mean there weren’t any conflicts about the school 4WD, or that local Aboriginal people did not exert some form of claim over the vehicle, but the conflict related to usage constraints, such as the number of passengers, rather than ownership.</Content>

It seems that her close kin association with her daughter facilitated her use of the Centre’s computers. Although most of the computers were installed within individual households, the circumstances surrounding the usage of the computers at the Women’s Centre – ostensibly a communal space – was indicative of a trend we noticed across the project communities: that residents did not share the computers as much as we had expected, especially beyond family groups.</Content>

    <Content>When we commenced the trial, we developed a system whereby the residents would sign an agreement that transferred ownership of the computers from us to them. The agreement was developed partly for legal reasons, and partly as a means to reinforce to the residents that they could manage the computers however they wished if they chose to take possession of them. Interestingly, despite their possessiveness, neither the couple nor anyone else signed ownership agreements for the two computers while they were at the Centre (which also appeared to be linked to the couple’s moderate degree of mobility, as we’ll discuss further in Chapter 4). Later, when the couple had left the community, another couple signed a formal ownership agreement for a Women’s Centre computer at Imangara within three months of it being relocated from the Centre into their house. This appears to support the understanding that an individual(s) who has non-exclusive usage rights to an item does not gain any additional powers, rights or personal standing, even if he or she is the person(s) primarily associated with it. Musharbash, for example, observed that specific bedrooms in a house were not ‘owned’ in the exclusive Western sense; rather, each room would be primarily associated with a particular person, who would nevertheless share access and use of it with others, usually those of the </Content>

    <Content>Initially, we installed two PCs in the CDEP shed at Mungalawarru for residents’ general use, but soon afterwards, one of these was relocated within the community. A woman signed a formal ownership agreement for the one that remained in the shed, and although it was still available for use by other residents, they consistently referred to it as the woman’s computer.

    <Content>In his work amongst Darwin’s town campers, anthropologist Basil Sansom (1980) observed a distinction between private and public ownership of items, including cash. Specifically, he used the term ‘routine’ ownership to refer to things, persons and words that were potentially available to other individuals through the mechanism of demand sharing. In contrast, when something was declared ‘private’, it was removed from the realm of social relationships and associated obligations, and was essentially ‘off limits’ to others. However, ownership of such items may move back and forth between the private and public domains over a period of time, according to the location (whether it is a private or public space) and other circumstances.</Content>

O’Connell’s observations about Alyawarr ownership of physical objects, such as everyday items found in houses, suggests that in addition to an item’s function, its cost and/or relative availability may be a factor in determining whether or not ownership remains with the individual purchaser, or whether the item becomes part of the assemblage owned by the household.</Content>

    <Content>These stories about desktop computers in shared spaces at Imangara and Mungalawarru highlight the strength of Aboriginal forms of ownership in remote communities. They also strongly suggest that the location of individual computers influences notions of, and the strength of, this ownership: i.e. that people with a desktop computer in their own house had a stronger claim/right to ownership of that computer (and by extension, demonstrate a particular type of ownership). By contrast, people who were notionally responsible for computers located in public spaces appeared to have weaker claims to some form of ‘ownership’, and/or demonstrated a different type of ownership, even though they were strongly associated with use and access to these computers. Ownership of computers in individual houses appeared to possess an exclusivity similar to Western legal notions, compared to computers in public spaces where ownership constituted a primary or shared/collective association.</Content>

    <Content>Contrary to our original expectations that Aboriginal social structures and practices might automatically foster greater sharing of ICT resources and skills amongst participants, with positive implications for diminishing the digital divide, the sharing of resources was concentrated on kinship networks between families and across households, and amongst individual families within houses. Even when computers were situated in public spaces, and not formally owned by a particular individual(s), this did not necessarily result in equitable access to ICT devices and the internet. In Chapter 9 we discuss how this has proven difficult in relation to shared internet facilities in a larger community.</Content>

    <Content>While discussing with us potential options for sharing internet connections after the project, one of the senior women at Imangara said she wanted her own ‘dish’, and that she only wanted to pay for her household’s usage. We asked if she would consider sharing a connection with the house next door, which was occupied by her daughter, her children and grandchildren. Her sister (by kinship), Mary, then interjected, pointing out that the arrangement might work, referring to her sister’s house as ‘you mob’ and her niece’s house as ‘that mob’.</Content>

She had significant responsibilities representing the community in external organizations, and was thus a key liaison for various visitors (including a linguist working in the community at the time). Mary, as we will see, was one of the few residents who came to rely on email for correspondence with outside agencies, although she did so with assistance from others. On this occasion, Mary pointed at a map of Imangara showing the location of the two existing satellite dishes and all the houses connected to the internet, indicating that she would share a dish with her mob. This included not only her immediate household, but her grandson and granddaughter-in-law in the house next door, another grandson and granddaughter-in-law in a house a bit further away, and another granddaughter and grandson-in-law, whose house was still further away, with other households in between.</Content>

    <Content>But on one of our previous visits, Mary’s granddaughter-in-law, Emily, had strongly asserted that everyone should have their own internet connection, and only pay for what each individual household used. Emily, who worked at the school and had a young family, had become one of the more confident users in the community. Emily was also quite financially literate, and likely to understand the difficulties that a shared arrangement would involve in terms of payment. Basically, payment for an internet plan can only be made from one individual’s account, which means that he or she would then have to extract a share of that payment from all the others who shared that connection. This would place an extra burden and responsibility on that individual.</Content>

Although Emily had previously expressed the view that everyone should have their own dish, she deferred to Mary on this occasion, appearing to accept her decision regarding a new arrangement in which only her household would share with Mary’s. Notably, by this time, Mary’s two grandsons and their partners were not to share with Mary, but to have their own internet connections. It seemed that Mary had not pressed them to review this decision, perhaps because it was her grandsons rather than her granddaughters who were involved, although it was two of her grand-daughters-in-law, including Emily, who told us about this decision.</Content>

    <Content>Emily may also have agreed to share with Mary out of a concern for Mary’s ability to pay for the internet connection on her own. The other reason for Emily’s change of mind might have been that her personal situation had altered between our two visits: her household income had halved after her partner lost his job. However, Emily later chose to have her own internet connection, while Mary and another granddaughter, who was looking after the house next door while its residents were interstate, decided they would share Mary’s connection.

    <Content>These developments were in keeping with the trend that emerged during the project on sharing ICT resources amongst kinship networks between families across households and amongst individual families within houses. Both Western legal ownership and Aboriginal ownership of the majority of the computers appears to have been vested in particular individuals, rather than to have taken the form of collective ownership by households or families. Eventually, all participants who decided to retain internet access chose to establish an individual household connection and account, with one exception (see Chapter 9). Another factor in the trend towards individual ownership was probably residents’ increasing awareness that a computer’s formal owner would have to bear the brunt of power and internet bill costs.</Content>

    <Content>During the project, we were interested in seeing whether participants would value computers differently from mainstream users, and how this might influence adoption and usage. Attitudes towards property in Aboriginal society operate on two levels: as a broad ‘world view’ perspective, and on a more personal level that allows for changes in individual attitudes according to various circumstances. As an example of the latter, Taylor observed a change in attitudes towards material possessions, from relatively frugal and generally confined to simple items (i.e. clothing, bedding, tools, weapons, utensils) to a desire for new furniture, furnishings and household appliances once people occupied permanent dwellings.</Content>

    <Content>In the case of the three communities, we considered the nature and extent to which participants valued the computers and internet access, and whether any changes in how they valued the ICTs emerged across the project. We took into account factors such as participants’ readiness to maintain internet access, what they were prepared to pay, and how community members personalized their computers, as indicators of what value they placed on home computers and internet access. We also attempted to assess the comparative value of the computers in relation to other material objects used by participants, such as cars, mobile phones, X-boxes, fridges and TVs, as well as the community payphone, as a means of gauging their significance in remote community life.</Content>

    <Content>By the end of September 2013, there were relatively high rates of formal ownership (signed agreements) of the computers and payment for internet plans at Imangara and Mungalawarru, suggesting that most participants valued the PCs and internet access. In the initial phases of the project, community members’ interest in having internet access grew considerably. Between February and November 2012, when we asked individuals regularly present in both these communities whether they’d be prepared to pay for their own internet service, the proportion of participants willing to pay increased from 40 to 77 per cent. Eventually, two-thirds of participants actually retained internet access; the remaining third did not because of mobility issues (i.e. they had moved or were anticipating moving from the community), or because they found the payment methods too difficult to manage. Given that project funding supported payment for internet use until September 2013, these results suggest that participants attached real value to maintaining connectivity at a tangible cost to themselves.</Content>

    <Content>We also periodically asked participants how much they’d be prepared to pay for internet access at the end of the project, as a gross measure of how much they valued the ICTs in monetary terms. When we first asked them in February 2012, only two individuals (a couple) out of fifteen nominated an actual amount. By contrast, in November 2012, twelve out of thirteen individuals nominated a sum of money, varying from $20/month up to $200-300/month, with three people saying they’d be prepared to pay at least $100/month. However, by March 2013, the amounts they named had moderated, coalescing around $40-$60/month, most likely as residents became better informed of the various plans available. Overall, it seems that a more pragmatic attitude emerged as the project progressed and once funding support ended.</Content>

          <Content>Peculiarities in the data relating to the type of internet connection are likely to have been the result of the way in which the survey was administered. The census is completed in remote communities with the assistance of ABS staff, who administer the survey door-to-door, whereas elsewhere it is completed by household members either online or on paper. The census asked residents what type of internet connection was available at the dwelling. The options included ‘broadband’, ‘dial-up’ and ‘other’, with an explanatory note that ‘other’ includes ‘internet access through mobile phones etc’. However, in Santa Teresa, a community with mobile coverage, no dwellings were identified as having an ‘other’ internet connection, while thirty houses chose ‘not stated’. In Yuendumu, twenty-seven houses stated that they had an ‘other’ connection and only three were not stated. There are a number of possible explanations for these inconsistencies, including whether the question was adequately explained to the participant, as well as confusion as to whether individual access to the internet via a mobile device is considered to belong to a dwelling or not. Despite these discrepancies, when grouped into ILOCs with mobile coverage and those without, the differences in internet adoption appear to be statistically significant.</Content>

    <Content> As an indication of the potential value people placed on their desktop computers, we examined how the residents personalized them, for example by posting photographs, usually of family members, as wallpaper and/or screensavers. When we visited the communities in 2014, almost half those we interviewed said they had personalized their computer. Of two people who stated that they hadn’t personalized their computers, we’d observed that one of these had changed her computer’s wallpaper before. Three said they couldn’t remember, although we’d previously noticed they had personally configured or chosen their computers’ wallpaper, and one individual had replaced the particular photograph she’d used earlier as wallpaper on her computer.</Content>

In September 2013, Mary asked one of the researchers to change the wallpaper on her computer, from the rather violent gaming image, which one of the younger male residents in her house had probably installed, to feature a gospel image. Personalization also occurred on computers in shared spaces: those managing the Women’s Centre put wallpaper featuring sports cars on the computers, although this may have been part of their attempt at possession of these computers.</Content>

    <Content>In opening this chapter, we suggested that Aboriginal people living in remote communities might value computers and the internet differently from the mainstream, with implications for their adoption and usage. The outstation residents clearly valued the computers and internet access, although, as we will see in later chapters, their relative value – as expressed in how they personalized the computers and valued them in relation to other household items – changed over the project. As we will see in later chapters, the amounts of money people were prepared to pay for internet access also changed as participants became increasingly aware of the real costs of retaining internet access, ownership and maintenance of the computer, especially electricity bills. The relative value of ICTs is also likely to fluctuate depending on an individual’s life circumstances; for example, when money is short, basics such as food, power and transport may take priority rather than fixing a computer or paying for an internet plan.</Content>

    <Content>Contrary to the idea that the ‘caring and sharing’ ethic (that non-Indigenous people often associate with Aboriginal culture) might result in more collective possession and use of the computers, ownership of most of the computers in the project became invested in particular individuals. Access, and by extension usage, was largely restricted to the household/immediate family members, with the owner determining who could use the computer. The use of passwords emerged as a key mechanism in managing demands, particularly from visitors and kids, and as a way of preventing unauthorized or excessive use of the computers when the owners were absent.</Content>

    <Content>Ownership is embedded within the system of demand sharing, in which objects may function as a mechanism through which social relationships are continually tested, mediated and re-negotiated. This understanding has implications for the design of future ICT arrangements, including payment method for internet access (discussed in Chapters 8 and 9)., In particular, flexibility to allow for changes in ownership and residential mobility needs to be incorporated into ICT provision to these communities, a subject that will be taken up in the next chapter.</Content>

    <Content>Six months after computers and internet access were installed at Kwale Kwale, Rhonda, a middle-aged woman who had been using computers at work, expressed concern to us that some of her older relatives drove forty kilometres to Alice Springs almost every day to shop, estimating that they spent about $30 per trip on fuel. She was hoping to teach them and other community members how to shop online for groceries and other supplies to reduce their transport costs. Her older relatives had already told us that they wished to avoid having to live in town to access medical services, and seemed stressed at the prospect of being away from country and family for any length of time. The same couple had moved into a caravan when another daughter and her family moved in, due to maintenance issues in their house. The family’s concerns are indicative of three types of mobility typical of outstations: the costs and inconveniences associated with living on an outstation, relocation to towns to access services, and individuals moving from house to house within a community, all of which we discuss in this chapter in relation to ICT.</Content>

    <Content>These seemingly ordinary concerns – relocation and travel – have a social dimension, in that living at a distance from essential services can contribute to hardship. The resulting fluctuating occupancy of remote settlements, and the expense that their remoteness confers on individuals and services, have been ever-present themes in the debate on government resourcing of outstations. The Commonwealth’s decision to direct resources to larger towns only (see Chapter 1), and its divestment of funding to the states, has resulted in a significant and (at the time of writing) ongoing social movement against the so-called ‘closure’ of remote communities. Underlying these developments has been what some consider a new policy trend of ‘mainstreaming’, whereby those living in outstations are expected to move to larger towns to reduce public expense. As discussed in previous chapters, researchers have been divided over the benefits of staying on country versus relocation, and the cultural and wellbeing advantages associated with each scenario.</Content>

    <Content>The frequency with which people travel and move also influences infrastructure and hardware choices. If travel was a common feature of everyone’s life, then this might explain why fixed satellite connections and desktop computers were scarce in remote communities when we commenced (as these cannot easily be moved). As we were to discover, mobility did affect internet access and use, not only for those who moved in and out of their community, but also for individuals and whole families moving to different houses within the community. The latter turned out to be a more significant issue for understanding the digital divide, adding further to our doubts about the appropriateness of the extant satellite internet offerings as a solution for remote consumers.</Content>

    <Content>Some participants wanted to learn how to shop online, but ran into difficulties because they didn’t have a debit or credit card, or they found having several passwords for different accounts confusing (a situation not uncommon amongst mainstream ICT users). In Mungalwurru a woman remarked: ‘I’ve got Facebook; I’ve got eBay. I get mixed up with all these passwords. So I just gave up’. Two-stage verification, which is becoming the norm for accessing accounts when the user has forgotten his/her password, is not possible in communities where there is no mobile reception.</Content>

    <Content>Overall, community members at Mungalawarru were less successful in learning to shop online, although there was probably less incentive for them to learn because Tennant Creek was only 80 kilometers away, and people frequented town for social reasons. People at Imangara, however, had much greater distances to travel to shop in either Alice Springs or Tennant Creek. For them, if they could not access a car or get a lift, then the next best option would be to get the bus from Ali Curung to Alice Springs, which costs around $80 for a one-way trip.</Content>

    <Content>While being able to purchase some items—even vehicles—over the internet contributed to the ease and convenience of community members’ lives, and most participants began regularly checking bank and Centrelink accounts online, these facilities did not, as we had speculated, lead to substantial changes in the frequency of their trips to regional centers for all residents. In 2012, when we asked the residents how often they visited town now that they had a home computer, almost half said they made the trip about as often as before, and the other half said that they travelled less or never to town. The frequency of visits varied from daily (only residents of Mungalawarru and Kwale Kwale, both of which are relatively close to town) to every six weeks (an Imangara resident). The reasons most often given for visiting town were catching up with family and friends, followed by shopping; they particularly mentioned accessing health services, but went also to visit the Central Land Council (CLC), banks and Centrelink, and to attend parties and sporting events.</Content>

    <Content>In late November 2011, the CLC informed us that there had been a road accident near the Ali Curung turnoff, which resulted in a triple fatality and multiple critical injuries, and that the accident involved Imangara residents. One young woman who had been closely involved with the computer trial, including working as a research assistant for us, was killed. We postponed our visits to Imangara, but the tragedy had a profound and extended impact on the community. The family, which occupied five houses in the community, initially moved out of Imangara—some to stay with relatives at 6 Mile at Ti Tree, and others to Utopia locations. The family’s relocation was part of the Alyawarr practice of memory and name suppression, a deliberate process of ‘forgetting’ in order to cope with grief.</Content>

Around this time, the family returned to Imangara because the children were not happy at the Ti Tree school, where the other kids spoke a different language. However, they did not return to the house where the deceased had lived. Instead it was boarded up and scheduled for redevelopment, after which a different family from the community would move in.

    <Content> Other instances were practical and social rather than cultural. For instance, Mungalawurru residents were forced to stay in Tennant Creek for a stretch of time as the roads had flooded, and told us of being forced to walk the long distance into town on past occasions. Some left for medical reasons (their own or others’), or to spend time with family in other communities. A couple of community members with young families became temporary migrants, moving to town so their children or grandchildren could attend school. An older man, who’d initially been fairly active in discussions about having computers and internet access at Imangara, moved to Tennant Creek for this purpose not long after the ICTs had been installed, as did a young family from Mungalawurru towards the end of the project. Such temporary relocation, of varying duration, was a recurring feature in our interaction with the residents. As Taylor writes, ‘Much temporary movement is generated by a spatial dichotomy between the concentration of services and dispersion of population, with the result that regional centers, especially in remote Australia, are net recipients of temporary migrants’.</Content>

    <Content>Some individuals were not particularly mobile, such as younger women with families, and also older women, for whom the young women often played a support role. Generally we found that these residents were more likely to identify themselves as the owner of a computer, and sooner than their more mobile counterparts. John Taylor has observed that young Aboriginal people in very remote areas appear to be less mobile than their counterparts in the non-Aboriginal and urban Aboriginal populations (in terms of moving for work etc.). He attributes the relatively low rates of out-migration by young people from remote and very remote Aboriginal settlements to ‘a cultural setting that places emphasis on maintaining extended kinship ties’ in which the establishment of independent living arrangements is ‘likely to be less of a stimulus for migration among young Aboriginal adults’.</Content>

    <Content>We discovered a clear association between residents’ degree of mobility and the likelihood that they would take up ownership of, and make use of, the computers. As a measure, we used the number of post-installation field visits where each individual was present in the community up to and including the time when the formal agreement was signed. Participants designated as exhibiting a relatively high degree of mobility were those present for less than a third of the field visits; those present for between one-third and two-thirds of visits, a moderate degree of mobility; and those present for more than two-thirds of visits, a low degree of mobility.</Content>

    <Content>Overall, highly-mobile individuals tended not to take up formal ownership of the computers (by signing an agreement stating it was their possession) as quickly or to the same extent as those who were less mobile. Of those who signed ownership agreements, the two-thirds who signed agreements in the first year (nine) were all less mobile, while the highly-mobile individuals signed the remaining third (six) towards the end of the project. Fourteen people whom we approached to sign did not, and these were all highly mobile. For example, one man moved to another community by mid-November 2012 and did not return, while another spent some months living in a different community. One individual spent some time in gaol, and by the time he was released, someone else had taken possession of his desktop computer. It is likely that highly-mobile people perceived ownership of a desktop computer as something of a tie or a constraint, indicating that internet services that are fixed to a particular residence are not viable for a significant proportion of people.</Content>

    <Content>Almost all participants chose desktops, which do not readily lend themselves to relocation. Mary, the senior woman at Imangara, hinted at this when we asked her how often the young men in her community used the computers. Gesturing at herself, her daughter, Emily, and another senior woman, she replied, ‘we don’t move around ‘cos we got the [satellite] dish on the house’, but the young men ‘move around a lot’. Mary’s house had one of two satellite dishes at Imangara, and her dish facilitated internet access for five other houses. Although Emily and the other senior woman did not have satellite dishes on their houses, they also became identified during the project as ‘the providers’ of the computers in their respective households. All three women were also amongst the least mobile of community members at Imangara. As Mary implied, this was in contrast to the young men, who were highly mobile (see discussion of gender in Chapter 7).</Content>

    <Content>While participants often moved out of the community, even for short periods, they were also comparatively mobile between houses within the communities, which sometimes resulted in them moving computers. As mentioned above, aside from death, the habitability of houses and buildings often played a role in families’ relocations within a community. At Mungalawurru, for example, a family moved back into a dwelling that had been vacant for a while after repairs to damage (caused by wasps) were made. Participants also moved out of houses, sometimes on a temporary basis, sometimes more permanently to another dwelling, when housing renovations and rebuilding occurred at Imangara.</Content>

    <Content>Several computers were moved within and from the communities during the project.

For instance, after the tragedy in Imangara, we did as requested and removed the images off the computer, taking it back to Alice Springs to do so. We later returned the computer to the original house, as the family seemed unsure about what to do with it. However, another family, who were not closely related to the deceased, had since occupied the house. That family later moved to another community, taking the computer with them. Later, when we visited Imangara in April 2014, we found that they had returned with the computer, and were living in another house.</Content>

    <Content>In another incident at Imangara, a young woman left to live in a community 100 kilometers away, taking her household’s computer with her. Other community members contacted the Centre for Appropriate Technology (CAT) expressing their concern. When we next visited Imangara, the senior male elder made a point of saying that she should not have taken the computer with her without consulting us. Clearly the young woman felt she had the right to take the computer with her, and considered that it was ‘hers’, whereas others saw it as a resource provided for all, but also that we had some power over the situation, having given it to the family in the first instance. Of the computers remaining at Mungalawarru, the only computer to ‘stay put’ in one house throughout the project was owned by the resident we most often found at home in the community (see Appendix 2).</Content>

    <Content>Participants’ degree of mobility, both within and outside the communities, has clear implications for ICT provision, including ownership of and access to computers and the internet. As to be expected, we found that less mobile participants – those more likely to stay put – took up computer ownership and internet plans sooner and more often than highly-mobile community members. Observing the degree and types of mobility, and the diverse reasons for moving within and out of the community, was revealing in other ways, providing a framework for understanding aspects of remote community living. For instance, cultural practices, including those associated with death, can impact significantly on housing and infrastructure needs. In terms of shopping, we observed how geographic isolation could lead to economic hardship (at worst caused by exploitative practices of businesses), and that internet access could provide people with a degree of agency over such transactions, a topic we explore further in the next chapter.</Content>

    <Content>Although we were initially interested in discovering the extent to which internet access might reduce community members’ amount of travel and the accompanying costs, the most significant findings related to infrastructure and hardware. As discussed in Chapter 2, most of the community members had opted for desktops, which they perceived as easier to manage, both in terms of the replacement of parts and ensuring that the computers were not taken out of the community. A family that is moving house and wants to retain the use of the computer for internet access must thus relocate the computer and associated accessories to a house with an existing broadband connection.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>The consequences for infrastructure arrangements are significant. For instance, the National Broadband Network (NBN) satellite scheme entails a fixed satellite dish and an account that is tied to a particular dwelling. Such arrangements mean that the somewhat informal movements within the community (such as moving in with relatives when there is no power in one house) will require going without internet access. Those who move a lot are not likely to enter into a contract with a retail service provider, and will therefore go without internet, at least when outside mobile broadband coverage. Indeed, devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops may have encouraged greater use of the internet for those who travelled frequently, or had responsibilities that took them away from home for extended durations. As the project progressed, we noticed a significant rise in smartphones and tablets, both in the communities and elsewhere. The evolving ecology of internet-enabled hardware in remote communities may ultimately involve a high proportion of mobile devices. However, the desirability of home computers should not be underestimated, especially for those permanently living in outstations, and who wish to manage and restrict access, or to maintain and replace parts easily.</Content>

    <Content>When we asked community members in our initial discussions how they would find out simple information such as weather forecasts, road conditions or football scores, they commonly said they would access such information on the television (where available and not necessarily their own) and by word of mouth. Some people said they would use the telephone, but this was far from straightforward (see telephone situation in Chapter 2). The only person amongst the three communities who was using computers at work told us that she printed out information ‘like a leaflet’ to give to others. A man commented that you had to be careful not to ‘shoot the messenger’ if you wanted to know what was going on.</Content>

Most responses fell evenly within the categories of either functional (Centrelink; Gumtree) or entertainment activities (movies, games, listening to songs, YouTube). These categories were similar to those that emerged when the residents were asked almost eighteen months earlier in November 2012 what activities they used the computers and internet for (see Appendix 3, Figure 1a). This suggests that their main areas of use hadn’t changed significantly in that time. The community members’ reported in November 2012 that usage for banking, downloading music, and viewing videos and photos were also amongst the types of activities they thought the computers and internet would be useful for at the project’s start. As discussed further below, use of the internet for email communication and educational purposes was fairly modest.</Content>

Around half of the websites visited we categorized as ‘miscellaneous’ sites, and search was regularly used to find information. The second-largest group of websites visited were videos, followed by religious sites and shopping. These uses indicate that the internet was a continuation of everyday activities for the residents, occurring within the same spread of priorities and concerns they had before the computers arrived, rather than seeking out new opportunities. For instance, although online education was theoretically accessible to residents, none took it up (although computers were used for existing educational activities, including supplementing kids’ school work in the form of educational games).</Content>

    <Content>The high interest in religious websites also reflected community activities and priorities at the time. Residents used the computers for personal and community-based religious activities such as downloading and playing gospel songs, printing out posters, and producing songbooks to use in the local church. It was not uncommon to find a picture of Jesus, printed on a home computer and captioned with, ‘He is coming’, taped to a community member’s front door, or to see Christian iconography used as a screensaver. One woman reported doing a Bible study online with someone in Mexico. On some of our visits, we were told that various people were absent because they were attending a sing-along or a gospel meeting at another community. On our last trip to Mungalawarru, a man who’d experienced a conversion during a stint in prison was reading the Bible on his house’s verandah while listening to Warlpiri, Pitjantjatjara and Waramunga gospel music he’d downloaded onto a USB stick.

In previous chapters, we have discussed how various programs have resulted in a patchwork of infrastructures in remote communities, resulting in different types of access and levels of adoption. The same can be observed at the level of uses, with short-term or ongoing programs encouraging or enabling certain uses in particular localities. For instance, the cultural archive Ara Irititja appears popular amongst the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people for whom it was created, but no such online archive exists for the language groups we were working with.</Content>

    <Content> Other programs have focused on the use of computers as part of diversionary youth programs. In Chapter 9, we discuss how internet use at the Papunya computer room differed from what we observed in the outstations, possibly due to a history of creative enterprise in that community, as well as greater access to face-to-face services and the circumstances surrounding its establishment. Keeping these differences in mind, the idea that use can be linked to cultural characteristics separate from the contemporary cultural landscape of remote communities is flawed. Internet use reflects daily life, but also the various activities and programs of outsiders that work in communities – including religious organizations.</Content>

    <Content> A 2011 Department of Treasury Taskforce on ATMs in remote communities found that there was a tendency amongst this population to check balances and make withdrawals frequently, and that this resulted in significant costs, as consumers in remote communities did not have a choice of ATMs as do those in larger towns. Independent ATM providers owned nearly 80 per cent of to the 600 ATMs in remote communities across the country at the time we commenced our study, and were depending on revenue from these ATMs (usually $2 per transaction). The taskforce report found that people were often checking balances and making withdrawals for various reasons, including the inability to store food and therefore a need to shop on a daily basis, the obligation to give money to relatives acting as a disincentive to hold large amounts of money at a time, and low withdrawal limits on ATMs if cash was in short supply.</Content>

    <Content>A significant and controversial change in how welfare was administered in remote Northern Territory communities also had consequences for personal finance control. As part of the Northern Territory Emergency Response (the Intervention, 2007-2012), welfare recipients in prescribed communities were subject to new measures from 2007 that meant that part of their payments (50-70 per cent) were quarantined and could only be spent on ‘basics’. To spend that money, individuals would use a BasicsCard to buy groceries and approved items (not alcohol or cigarettes, for instance) through an EFTPOS-style system. People were automatically enrolled in the scheme, although they could apply to be made exempt from it, assessed on whether their children were attending school regularly, and whether they were shown by Centrelink to have reasonable financial stability.</Content>

Accessing social security services via satellite broadband at home was also cheaper than doing so by mobile phone, as 1800 numbers were metered at that time (Telstra, the sole provider in most remote areas, has since made 1800 numbers free for mobiles).</Content>

Women tended to make greater use of the computers and internet access for household administrative activities than men (discussed further in Chapter 7).

    <Content>The hybrid economy was visible within all three communities insofar as residents supported themselves on a mixture of social security payments and local employment. The cattle project at Mungalawarru, aspirations to develop cultural tourism at Kwale Kwale, and bush foods at Imanagara were instances of the customary activities that represented the possibility of enterprise. One question we had was whether improved telecommunications could assist these ‘off-the-grid’ communities in developing a base for economic sustainability, assisting Aboriginal people to live on their traditional lands.</Content>

Another man who ran a youth respite service suggested he might use a computer to keep a database tracking outcomes across five projects.

    <Content>In October 2011, we were told that the Apostolic (Baptist) church was providing resources to partly refurbish some houses, and to build a small backpacker camping ground, a vegie garden and a shop. The computers were initially seen as an asset in this overall plan. By early 2012, considerable work had been done, and we were told that the community was aiming for self-sufficiency over 10 years. The church members were living onsite, and appeared to have a significant influence in guiding the direction of the community, although it was difficult to ascertain whether the ideas were coming from the church or from the community. A few months later, one of the visiting pastors advised us that the computers had been declared off-limits in order to stop kids from playing games, and to prevent any other inappropriate use. At the pastor’s request, we took the computers away to ‘clean’ them, but found no evidence of inappropriate material, and both machines still had their filters set to ‘child’ (the highest level of filtering).</Content>

    <Content>By September 2012, there was a sign by the turn-off to Kwale Kwale that read, ‘Art for sale’, and the vegetable patch was producing crops that were consumed by the residents during an evening meal organized by the pastor. The elder woman in the community, while painting gumnuts, told us that she wanted the children to be able to play games, and that it wasn’t up to the pastor to determine what the children did. One of the derelict houses was undergoing repairs for an intended arts center. The work had been carried out by the church members, with some assistance from the residents, and we were informed that Rhonda was the driving force behind the project. The next stage of the project would be to build a walking trail for tours, and to establish a restaurant and small caravan park. While relaying this, the pastor asked that two computers originally placed in the community shed be returned – one of the computers into the building being refurbished for the arts center for use by the business, and the other to a house for one of the residents to use. These moves required some significant reconfiguring of the technical arrangements, which CAT set about organizing. While one computer was eventually moved into the resident’s house, months later it seemed that progress on the art gallery had stalled due to lack of money, and the community’s artists had begun making their art work and selling it through Tangentyere Art Centre. Over time, our visits to Kwale Kwale slowed compared to the other two communities. Rhonda, who had access to computers at work, requested assistance from us from time to time, but we received mixed messages as to the value and use of the computers in Kwale Kwale. No-one chose to continue a subscription to internet services at the completion of the funded period.</Content>

    <Content>The church’s involvement in the community was an instance of the non-government sector stepping in to assist in the absence of other programs. The moral influence of the church may have been a factor in the community’s oscillating attitudes towards ICTs and how they should best be provided. Although it was not possible to fully know how these events were impacting on the community, Kwale Kwale does illustrate the ways in which some communities are actively pursuing enterprise and sustainability, in this case with assistance from willing workers and missionaries. As mentioned previously, downloading Aboriginal gospel music was popular in both Imangara and Mungalawurru, and the influence of various Christian churches was apparent throughout the region.</Content>

    <Content>In July 2012, Karen at Mungalawurru announced to us: ‘I don’t run up to answer the phone because I get email’. Like her comments about the convenience of having a home computer to check online banking and Centrelink accounts, she’d realised it was easier to rely on email for communications than on the community payphone. Karen described emailing more people, maybe five a week, and receiving emails from the cattle project, the CLC and friends. But she was also one of a handful of residents on whom organizations like the CLC and CAT relied to communicate with the community about matters such as scheduling visits.</Content>

    <Content>Although people identified contacting friends and family outside the community as one of the main advantages of having ICT access, extensive social use of email did not develop during the project. It soon became apparent that apart from having the basic applications, both parties needed ready access to the internet to have the regular habit of checking their email, and to leave their Skype application turned on. Initially, we tried to speed up the process by passing on to the residents the email addresses of regular contacts (a local accountant, CLC, Barkly Arts), with their permission. We also tried to increase community members’ familiarity with e-communication by activating programs such as Outlook and Skype at start-up, and by regularly sending email messages to all the computers to maximize their chance of being read. Co-author Andrew Crouch at CAT received some emails from Imangara in the next few months, with queries like: ‘How can I do such-and-such […]’ or, ‘How can I obtain a Hotmail account?’, which he was able to resolve online. In total, between when the computers were installed in 2011 and the end of 2012, Andrew had only a total of only 109 emails from residents, either initiated by them or in response to an email he sent. Nonetheless, when asked whom they emailed, those using email mostly responded that Andrew was the main person they liaised with. It seemed the main reason why e-communication did not emerge as one of the major uses of ICT was because people didn’t have friends and family outside the communities with functional email accounts.</Content>

They did not express much ‘worry about kids’ regarding what they might access online; instead, they were concerned about addiction to games and time-wasting behavior. Adults thought kids were pests when it came to media devices, especially as they ‘get upset when they don’t get to use it’. They also spoke of kids bugging them to play games on mobile phones, and of locking their games console away, saying they would do the same with a computer when they had one and, as discussed in Chapter 3, they began to set passwords to restrict access to computers later in the project.</Content>

Emily showed us books with photos and stories that she had created with her children on the home computer.

Just under a third, all young adults, who were also most often the parents of young children, gave an unqualified ‘yes’ in response. Children using up the internet quota or power was, however, a continuing source of irritation, with one man remarking that his household needed to ‘manage power use’ as a result of kids’ frequent computer use. As part of its Codey cybersmart project, arts provider Barkly Arts produced an educational poster captioned: ‘Plugging in your phone at home to get on the Internet uses power and costs money.

When we visited Papunya in May 2012, some elders were worried about cyber-bullying occurring if mobile phone towers were installed in the community (which did not happen until 2014). They said being at Papunya gave young people a break from the ‘trash talk’ on mobile phones that went on when they were in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, and they didn’t want conflict emerging from cyber-bullying and sexting in their community.</Content>

    <Content>They were particularly aware of how cyber-bullying had fed conflict between two camps aligned with different families in Yuendumu, a major Aboriginal community 262 kilometers drive away, which were exacerbated when people from Hermannsburg (420 kilometers from Yuendumu) began to send inflammatory phone messages. Some of these were sent anonymously through false identities created on the social media platform Divas Chat (airG) using the names of deceased relatives from the other camp, a highly provocative gesture, given the restrictions in local Aboriginal culture on naming or viewing images of the dead. Ultimately, the situation was managed with the assistance of the Australian Federal Police and ISP providers to identify and close the social networking accounts of people sending offensive messages, and to appoint monitors (e.g. ‘Diva Cops’) in chat rooms to identify and report potential concerns.</Content>

We began to hear from local organizations that some Aboriginal elders and parents were disturbed by reports that kids had been involved in cyber-bullying, something they knew little about. Children had been texting each other during school hours, with physical fights erupting from arguments online. Sometimes, older relatives weighed into kids’ spats on Facebook; on other occasions, the conflict spread beyond families to communities outside Tennant Creek, to people they might have met once or twice, and even to total strangers. As at Yuendumu, people set up false profiles on social media using names and images of the deceased to taunt others.</Content>

    <Content>Most of the activity was associated with mobile phones, and some kids from nearby communities without mobile coverage were going to great lengths to access social media. In some cases, kids stole their parents’ cars and drove to get service to be able to text their girlfriends or find out the footy scores, so keen were they to keep up with what was happening. There were also stories of inter-racial cyber-bullying erupting around tension at football matches, and of racist comments being posted on Facebook walls, especially under photos of different racial groups in Tennant Creek.</Content>

    <Content>The key issues identified in our Tennant Creek research and in the RIPIA report indicate that digital literacy and proficiency are the crux of the matter for remote Aboriginal people in responding to cyber-safety. In particular, the privacy problems posed by social media are not well understood: people in remote communities are often unaware that ‘anybody in the world can see them’ online. A youth worker in a Barkly community said that ‘nobody has privacy settings and nobody wants them’, even though she’d tried to persuade people of the value of using them on Facebook. She described how: ‘Someone might post on Facebook at three in the morning saying: “I’m going to have a sniff now” or a drink, and everyone in the community will read it.’ A woman at Ali Curung told us that she changed her sim card in her phone regularly so she would not have to receive and read text messages intended for others. This was because of the high prevalence of phone sharing.</Content>

    <Content> Faced with extensive disadvantage and a large youth population – 25 per cent of people in the Barkly are under 17 – it’s understandable that elders, along with schools and the community sector, fear that cyber-bullying may exacerbate existing social problems in Tennant Creek. But many of the anxieties about cyber-safety issues relate to the cultural and digital disconnects between older and younger generations, and to uncertainty about how to navigate the dynamics between these worlds. One community worker said: ‘People split it up between their cultural responsibilities and then their Facebook/Divas personality. But when it suits them, they’ll be in the other world.’ This dichotomy between digital and cultural worlds is often framed in terms of a cyber culture identified with youth, and outside the controls and protocols of traditional culture. This attitude is typically associated with older Aboriginal people.</Content>

    <Content>Cyber-safety became an issue in the region during the years we visited the outstations. Developing proficiency in using social media and ICTs across different age groups is key to empowering remote community members to manage these issues. At a deeper level, the issue of cyber-safety demonstrates that platforms such as Facebook and Divas Chat are significant elements of the media ecology in remote communities, and are as important as infrastructure. Although corporate platforms can behave in the public interest, whether and how they are able respond to the particular dynamics of remote communities when problems arise is a more complex question, and one that requires further research.</Content>

    <Content>Overall, the emphasis on personal and family uses of the computers appears to have developed from the location of the ICTs in the home, in conjunction with the smallness and remoteness of the communities, the degree of mobility of some participants, and the relative newness of ICTs to community members as users. Different community members also displayed different levels of enthusiasm for the ICTs, and used them to varying degrees. In a study of older internet users, Selwyn, Gorard and Furlong found that internet use was generally a means of pursing existing interests rather than creating new interests: ‘People who were using the internet on a broad and frequent basis were generally building upon and extending previously developed interests or using the internet as part of a repertoire of IT and non IT-based means.’</Content>

    <Content>More complex and more elaborate uses of the computers would possibly require significant training and assistance – issues that will be taken up in Chapter 6. Simple, everyday changes represented by the use of the home computers for administrative activities indicate, however, the potential value that internet access represents for smaller settlements, for example, in connecting to mainstream agencies, in contrast to larger communities with existing access to on-site services (i.e. at the community store and Regional Council office). In this way, ICT access for highly-remote people is particularly significant as governments shift as much service delivery as possible from ‘over-the-counter’ and/or postal methods to an online-only environment. Without this, there is a real risk that many remote Aboriginal people will simply ‘drop offline’ and be further disadvantaged.</Content>

    <Content>As early as February 2012, Karen described how she’d helped others in the community use the computers, especially to access Centrelink accounts, including her husband and a couple of female relatives, commenting that it was ‘more me showing them’ than anyone telling her what to do. She may have been saying this to impress on us how ICT proficient she’d become; several months later, she was adamant she hadn’t shown anyone else how to do things on the computer, nor had anyone else shown her how to do anything. Other community members, however, reported Karen assisting them in such tasks as using email, setting a computer password and negotiating Centrelink’s website. On a later field trip, Karen commented that while ‘everyone has different bank accounts’, they ‘might use [her] computer to check money in their account’. Another young woman at Mungalawarru also observed that other people, both men and women, often asked Karen to help them use the computer, though she herself didn’t ask Karen for help.</Content>

When we asked her in August 2013 whether she’d been assisting anyone else with Centrelink, she replied, ‘I don’t really like doing other people’s stuff’. By this point, as we’ll discuss in Chapter 7, Karen had become more autonomous in her use of the computer, because she’d moved it into a separate room mainly for her own use.</Content>

    <Content>Mary, the senior women at Imangara from Chapter 5, played a prominent role in liaising with us, and in discussions about distribution of ICT resources within the community. But like most older and some middle-aged people in the three communities, and also those at Papunya and Ali Curung, she had no previous ICT skills or experience of computers. On our first research trip to Imangara, Mary commented that ‘only Andrew’ from the Centre for Appropriate Technology (CAT) had shown her how to do things on the computer. On subsequent visits, she told us that her granddaughter, who was in her early 20s, had assisted her. When the young woman left the community to live in Alice Springs for a while, Mary said that her grandson was now helping her use Centrelink and online banking sites. The granddaughter later returned and resumed living with her grandmother. Her cousin, another young woman living in a neighbouring house, also named Mary’s granddaughter as the person who’d taught her how to access YouTube, play games online and print photos. This granddaughter had a high pre-existing level of ICT proficiency: for example, she had a Hotmail email address, as well as Twitter and Facebook accounts, which she accessed on her mobile phone outside the community before it had internet connectivity. While living in the community, she sent emails to CAT, asking them to bring replacement inks and other items on their next visit.</Content>

    <Content>However, we also gained the impression that the granddaughter was monopolizing use of the computers in two houses, without giving as much assistance to her grandmother as she could have done, such as showing her how to use email: Mary continued to request that we help her with basic administrative activities well into 2013. As with the account of Karen’s cooling towards her ‘ICT help’ role, this story suggests that Aboriginal people, even more digitally-proficient community members, will not necessarily assist each other to use ICTs by sharing skills, or that younger people will help older ones negotiate online services, for reasons that we’ll discuss below.</Content>

    <Content>These stories are indicative of digital literacy and skills transfer trends that emerged during the project. Generally, younger residents (18-29 years), like Karen at Mungalawarru, and Emily and Mary’s other granddaughters at Imangara, who had computing experience from school or elsewhere, were more self-sufficient with using ICTs. They usually only asked us for specific assistance with problems or complex tasks, which fell more within the category of technical or application support than training. When we asked participants whether they thought they were getting better at using computers, 18-29-year-olds most often (approximately one-third of self-assessments), said they’d improved during the project.</Content>

    <Content>In our initial meetings with the three communities, we found that rates of computer non-adoption were proportionately highest amongst those aged 45-60 years (88 per cent non-adopters), and 60+ years (83 per cent non-adopters). Physical disability, such as poor eyesight or conditions such as back or leg problems, compounded their reluctance to use computers.

    <Content>Although elders like Mary often played pivotal roles in discussions about the project, and in decision-making about distributing ICT resources, their level of ICT usage tended to be relatively basic, and they often struggled with learning new skills. Senior women and men maintained roles in managing ICT resource distribution, which younger community members respected during meetings (as in the story about Mary and Emily at Imangara), even when they had plans to make different arrangements about their computer and internet access. Importantly, we would not describe Mary as a non-user, as she regularly asked others to conduct online transactions on her behalf. What has been described as ‘use-by-proxy’ is important, as it demonstrates that even those who do not have the skills or inclination to use the internet might still be experiencing its benefits.</Content>

    <Content>Schools are key providers of computers and internet access in remote Australia; they act as conduits for various ICT programs, and have been teaching digital literacy skills to children, and sometimes to parents and teachers’ assistants. Although a full study of ICTs in remote schools was beyond our means, we called in at schools on a number of occasions to talk informally with the teachers, and made contact with the one program that promoted at-home use of devices, One Education (a spin-off of the international NGO, One Laptop per Child). These encounters provided us with some insights into schools as sites of internet access. For example, the Murray Downs school near Imangara was connected to the internet via satellite.</Content>

    <Content>Our general impression was that school-based internet and computer use could vary significantly depending on the teacher. Only 40 per cent of teachers in very remote schools in the Northern Territory stay teaching at the same school for more than a year. Such high teacher turnover (see Brasche and Harrington, 2012, for reasons why this is the case) means that there is no consistent approach to ICTs. Some teachers had narrow ideas of what is appropriate use in the classroom environment, and even teachers who are optimistic about the use of technology for learning, do not necessarily wish to support activities beyond those which fit within lesson plans.</Content>

    <Content>Does such a limited experience of ICTs at school impact on attitudes and use of ICTs later in life?

Although we were not able to pursue this question fully, we did observe that at the start of our project in 2010, none of those under 30 who had used computers at school had gone on to purchase a computer for use at home. However, these participants were certainly more confident users than those without any prior experience of computers.</Content>

The program’s biggest issue was teacher turnover: as teachers voluntarily participate in the program, if a replacement teacher does not wish to participate, the laptops can go unused. Nonetheless, the program was providing a level of training and a community of practice for teachers, who overwhelmingly believed that the devices were good for learning. Schools and one-to-one laptop programs will remain an important means of ICT skills development in remote communities.</Content>

    <Content>At the project’s outset, we were uncertain how much people would share the computers or teach each other how to use them. So-called ‘avoidance relationships’ between the genders and within kinship networks exist within Aboriginal society, such as it being considered taboo for a son-in-law to speak with his mother-in-law. There are also continuing protocols concerning the transfer of knowledge between older and younger people. Karen’s increasingly personal use of the computer and her disinclination to help others underlines Chapter 3’s insight that households, and even individuals, in these remote central Australian Aboriginal communities can be autonomous. This emphasis on personal and household ICT use, together with the limited skills-sharing that took place, have implications for providing training and support, and for facilitating socially-inclusive ICT arrangements in remote Aboriginal communities. They also put notions about an ‘Aboriginal preference’ for group or communal learning to the test.</Content>

    <Content>While several people said during early meetings that children should be allowed on computers because they can teach others how to use them, there wasn’t much evidence of inter-generational sharing of ICT skills on the outstations. The relatively-limited amount of skills transfer that occurred runs counter to what a popular understanding of the ethos of Aboriginal culture might suggest: for example, that sharing practices might automatically foster sharing of ICT resources and skills amongst participants. It also challenges early assertions by telecommunications academics and policymakers in mainstream debates that the digital divide will fix itself as network and equipment costs fall and the internet becomes more and more a part of daily life.</Content>

    <Content>While we did not seek to provide any accredited form of training, or to undertake formal assessments, we decided that, when asked, we would help those who wanted to learn. Training in the use of computer and internet applications often occurred on an ad hoc basis on house visits while providing technical support during the CAT team’s regular maintenance visits, and sometimes on research trips to the communities. Virtually all of these interactions were face-to-face; very few could have been carried out using remote communication, given that none of the households had a fixed landline telephone or mobile phone access. Residents rarely used email or Skype to ask how to do something or to solve a problem. On the couple of occasions when this happened, the issue almost always required personal follow-up during a community visit.</Content>

    <Content>Community members who maintained an interest in the computers were often those who already had a degree of digital literacy and were more likely to seek help. Some improvements in participants’ skill levels were evident during the project. For example, when we asked them six months into the trial whether they had gotten better at using the computer, two-thirds replied positively, listing new or improved skills related to using email; on-line banking; typing; word processing; folder and desktop management; writing letters, stories and songs; use of spreadsheets; downloading material (movies, music and games); Facebook; and viewing photographs and other pictures.</Content>

    <Content>But a year into the project, it became apparent that without further digital education and skills development of some kind, other remote community members, especially older ones, were likely to find dealing with services, such as banks and government agencies that increasingly rely on internet interfaces, particularly challenging. Consequently, we devoted more attention in the second half of 2012 to investigating what training approaches might provide the most benefits for remote Aboriginal residents, especially given their range of ICT skills and the particular social practices and protocols operating within these communities.</Content>

We also asked whether they had any specific physical needs, such as glasses or hearing aids, and tried to assess how avoidance relationships might affect training situations. At the time, almost 60 per cent of the residents were available, a situation that was not unusual given that numbers of community members present on field trips varied throughout the project. Those who took part in discussing these training issues were broadly representative of participants, possessing a range of literacy and numeracy skills, and including young men and women aged in their 20s and 30s, as well as older women in their 40s, 50s and 60s.</Content>

Familiarity with the surroundings, equipment and people appeared to be important, combined with the ease of not having to travel to town, which involves additional costs, as well as organizing transport and accommodation.

Several people named the same tasks as activities that they already felt confident doing, perhaps indicating that they wished to become more proficient at that task, or that they wished to learn additional or more complex tasks within an application. Community members did not always say explicitly why they wanted to learn different activities, although some said they wanted to ‘get better’ at a certain task, to enhance their existing employment skills, or to contact Centrelink more easily.</Content>

    <Content>We also asked about their preferred group composition (age and gender) for training, and whether there were any cultural relationships that might preclude anyone from being in the same room as someone else. No-one expressed any particular preferences about age or gender, apart from one elderly woman who said she’d rather learn with women only. Similarly, only one person, again an older woman, identified cultural avoidance of individuals either from within their community or from another community as a potential issue. Her response, that she could not be in the same room as anyone from another community, concurred with anecdotal evidence suggesting that, in remote central Australian communities, the older generations (elders) continue to uphold traditional cultural practices in relation to interpersonal relationships. None of the younger community members identified avoidance relationships as an issue, which is in keeping with observations that younger generations sometimes place less emphasis on maintaining these traditions.</Content>

    <Content>The findings from the discussions we had with community members about learning preferences suggested that it might be appropriate to reconsider some of the commonly-held notions about adult Aboriginal people preferring to learn in groups, particularly in regard to ICT training. This confirmed the ad hoc approach to learning that had already emerged in the project, in which we often spent time with individuals and one or two other family members in their homes, responding to their requests for training and technical support on the computer. During the remainder of the project, we tried to fine-tune this approach, which could best be described as opportunistic and flexible, by providing training tailored to individual adult community members’ needs, aspirations and preferences.</Content>

    <Content> Consequently, the CAT team set aside additional time for training during their technical support trips. In practice, about 70 per cent of their time was spent on providing technical support, and 30 per cent on training during each visit. An average of four learning opportunities per visit to each community occurred, varying from none – for example when participants were absent or researchers’ time was taken up entirely with managing technical incidents – to sixteen. The CAT team also occasionally received and responded to support requests from community members by email or phone between visits.</Content>

    <Content>Learners largely determined the session’s length, although it was impacted to a lesser extent by competing demands on our time. Sessions ranged from short-task specific learning opportunities of ten to twenty minutes to intensive three-hourly sessions in which community members participated in a range of activities. Almost three-quarters of the learning opportunities occurred as one-on-one sessions between the learner and the researcher, 20 per cent in pairs and 9 per cent in groups, reflecting participants’ preferred learning modes.</Content>

    <Content>In most (71 per cent) of these sessions, participants determined what they wished to learn, usually by asking us a question such as: ‘Could you show me how to [undertake a certain activity]?’ We demonstrated how to do that particular task several times, and then asked the participant to repeat it until they felt confident. Overall, most of the learning opportunities and participants’ training revolved around using the internet, despite us urging them to learn maintenance (see Appendix 3, Figure 6). However, on occasions, learning also occurred when researchers were occupied with providing technical support rather than training: community members learned computer maintenance tasks mainly by watching us change ink cartridges, clear ink nozzles, and other trouble-shooting activities associated with printers and, to a lesser extent, the computers themselves. Occasionally, we suggested certain tasks we felt participants might be interested in learning, or that they would need to know before the move to self-funded internet plans (see Appendix 3, Figure 5).</Content>

    <Content>Towards the end of the trial, we attempted to organize group training for some community members at Imangara who wanted to try this style of learning, and for researchers to compare the individual and group experiences. The proposed activity was a one-day Digital Stories workshop to be delivered by a multi-media trainer from Barkly Arts in a meeting room at Ali Curung, 30 kilometers away. But when a couple of our researchers arrived in Imangara the day before the workshop to remind community members that it was happening (they had sent email messages beforehand), the place was a ghost town. Only one older woman appeared to be there, sitting on her verandah. She told us that the others were ‘all gone’: some to Tennant Creek for a royalty meeting; the others, including Mary, for a funeral and a sing-a-long at Lake Nash. She had wanted to go with them, but they left without her. She told us they might be back ‘tonight [Tuesday] or tomorrow’.</Content>

    <Content>Driving towards Imangara the next morning, we met a car of people from Ali Curung, who told us that everyone was going on to Mount Isa now for a rodeo, and that no-one would be back until Monday at the earliest. A little later, we saw a couple of people on the road who turned out to be Mary’s relatives. We offered them a ride and they asked us to go back up the road to get another couple. The four of them had been at the roadhouse bar at Wauchope the night before, but their car had broken down and they’d slept inside with no blankets, which was apparently very cold. When we found them, the couple asked to be dropped in Ali Curung so they could arrange to get the car.</Content>

By the time we offered group training, the novelty value of computers and trying to do new things on them had also worn off, although the computers had by then become a valued as part of household infrastructure that people seemed to want to maintain.</Content>

    <Content>In remote Indigenous communities, age and gender differentials impact on learning opportunities, as do relationships between family groups. We found that individual learning within private households in a way that was responsive to the participant’s needs and requests for training was the most equitable and inclusive approach. People were also more likely to be interested in uses of the internet that brought small but noticeable benefits to their everyday lives.</Content>

    <Content>Our experience was thus contrary to the commonly-held notion that Aboriginal people like to learn in groups, at least when it comes to computers and associated software. That the subject matter (computers) was the same as the learning mechanism, and that it was delivered in an informal home environment, goes only partway towards explaining the preference for individual learning. The emphasis on everyday uses of the computers and internet within a domestic setting, combined with the trend towards discrete family and household ownership and use of the computers, probably strongly influenced the desire for individual learning within these small communities.</Content>

    <Content>When we commenced, Karen’s husband had a laptop, which he had borrowed from a relative. The laptop had been purchased in another state, and he believed the WiFi only connected to the internet there. Karen did not use the laptop. Not long after the communities received computers and internet access, some women began to play a key role in using the computers for household purposes. As discussed in Chapter 5 (Uses), Karen described managing her family’s administration by accessing Centrelink every day, paying bills and trying to teach her husband how to pay his Austar account online. Her husband, on the other hand, reported using the computer for work purposes to check emails from his employer on the cattle project. In 2012, Karen said they were equally responsible for the computer, but by 2013, she reported that keeping it safe was, ‘a bit of [him], most of me; if I’m not around, he makes sure it’s closed. Yeah, and kids aren’t on it. If something happens—maybe [the kids] throwing the mouse around—he tells me’. She now used the computer the most, whereas he was ‘always busy on his playstation’. They swapped if they got bored, and, ‘If there’s something on my computer he wants, he grabs it, puts it on a USB stick, then onto his playstation’.</Content>

    <Content>Later when Karen took us to see the computer on the same visit, her husband was sleeping face down on a foam mattress in their living room, exhausted from the day’s mustering. Karen led us into the spare bedroom where the computer was kept: there was almost nothing inside apart from the computer in its box on a desk. Karen and her husband were like a couple with their own toys, with him on the playstation in the main room and her on the computer in its separate room. Although she said the kids used the computer as well, the pride with which Karen maintained the room suggested that it was her personal space.</Content>

    <Content>In the same community, another woman soon assumed responsibility for her household’s computing activities, commenting that while her husband only used the computer for playing card games, he often requested that she perform administrative tasks for him, such as sending emails on his behalf to staff at the Central Land Council (CLC) and the cattle project. When we asked him why he wasn’t using the computer so much, he claimed that he didn’t know how, and that he was too busy to learn, although he wouldn’t mind being able to manage information about the cattle project, such as mustering details, prices and sales, on the computer. Several months later, he had still not made any progress in learning how to use the computer, and was instructing his wife to write reports for the cattle project. Cynthia said: ‘He tells me what to write, and I write and print it out. I check incoming email every morning.’ She also printed out emails for another male relative.</Content>

    <Content>At Kwale Kwale in February 2012, Rhonda, the tertiary-educated middle-aged woman who worked part-time in Alice Springs, told us that she wanted to teach her husband to use the computer, but he was ‘too frightened to go near it’. She was also hoping to set up Skype so he could talk to his daughters, who lived away from the community. Rhonda said she wanted to learn how to access internet banking, shopping and Centrelink so she could teach others in the community how to use them, along with Skype and making Microsoft word documents. In Chapter 5, we discussed how she had planned to use word processing programs on the computer to make multi-lingual books about bush tucker with another community member. She had also thought she might order groceries online from supermarkets in Alice Springs, which she could sell, along with home-grown vegetables, at a stall in the community. She reported using the computer mostly to contact friends by email as well as doing contract work; another community member described Rhonda using her home computer as her ‘office’.</Content>

    <Content>As these stories suggest, certain young and middle-aged women came to play a key role in taking responsibility for the computers within individual households, often using them for administrative purposes, sometimes on behalf of other family members. The computers became a domestic hub of sorts, an extension of everyday practices associated with a more female-oriented sphere, including banking, online shopping and child-related educational activities. While community members all mentioned using the computers for personal entertainment and administration, women more often listed accessing Centrelink and internet banking than men in their top five activities on the computer (see Appendix 3, Figure 3A). They also described shopping online for items such as car parts, cars, garden stuff, music CDs, plates, forks, iPads, kids’ games, bibles, bible tapes, Christian books and a laptop. Men mainly reported using the computers to play games or to watch movies (see Appendix 3, Figure 3B), and often seemed happy to allow women to manage household finances online as well as contacting local organizations on their behalf.</Content>

    <Content>Community members identified women, followed by children, as the computer’s most frequent users, with women making up two-thirds of those aged 18-29 years (see Appendix 3, Figure 2). When we asked participants to assess their level of computer skills, women (roughly one-third) and 18-29 year olds (again, approximately one-third) gave the most positive self-assessments of their computer skills, which supports the observation that women, especially the younger ones, had developed greater digital literacy skills during the project. These trends correlate with those from our original survey of community members’ computer experience of skills prior to installation, which found a greater proportion of women (52 per cent) had some ICT proficiency in contrast to men (29 per cent).</Content>

Once again, youth was a significant factor, again suggesting a correlation between this role and higher levels of digital literacy: mainly women (86 per cent) aged 18-29 years at Imangara and only women and men in their 20s and 30s at Mungalawarru were named as responsible for the computers.</Content>

    <Content>One young man in his early 20s stayed at Mungalawarru for about 12-18 months, sharing a computer with four other young adults and a child in a mutual living space at a house transitory community members tended to occupy. When we first met him in July 2012, he reported using the computer for fairly basic purposes – to check emails, to browse the internet and to download music – but said that he ‘wouldn’t pay to keep it; I don’t use it enough’. He also mentioned the role that young women played in assisting him to use the computer, saying that he’d been watching others print out letters and photos, and access Centrelink online, which he wanted to learn how to do himself. However, he identified the main obstacle to him in using the computer as being that ‘sometimes others using it stops me from using it’.</Content>

    <Content>Four months later, he said that two young women used the computer most in his house, one of whom he identified as being the person who looked after the computer. While he thought he was using the computer the ‘same amount’ as before, he said that he had improved ‘by looking at other people using it’, citing checking BasicsCard balances as something he had learned in this way. He named Karen first as someone who had shown him new activities, then Andrew, who ‘showed him little bit email’. Karen, who was listening in on the conversation, remarked that the young man ‘tells me if I have an important one’. The young man was more positive about the value of ICT access since we’d last spoken to him, saying he thought the computers had been ‘great – awesome, eh’ for the community, because people could ‘download music, videos; look at entertainment’. As a result, he ‘stay[ed] in Mungalawarru more. At town, [you] do nothing’. He also said he would be happy to pay $30 per month for an internet plan.</Content>

    <Content>This man’s story, as someone who was initially disinterested in ICTs until he saw their benefits, demonstrates how community members with lower degrees of digital literacy may engage more with ICTs if they’re exposed to their use. A year or so after we first met him, however, he had left Mungalawarru, which, as we discussed in Chapter 4, was not an uncommon pattern amongst young men in remote communities, who are more likely than young women to need to travel to find work. There are also cultural precedents for young men to live a transitory lifestyle; Myers describes how until they have married (often in middle age amongst the Pintupi) and have passed through further stages of instruction conducted by older men, ‘young men cannot settle down, cannot stay in one place’.</Content>

At Mungalawarru, men were often involved in a local cattle project and hunting, which meant they weren’t always present when we were visiting, or that they returned in the late afternoon just as we were leaving the community. In households where participants reported men using the computers for entertainment and administrative purposes, they often came to rely on, or to expect that women, especially female partners, would perform administrative tasks for them on the computers, even within a few months after installation.</Content>

    <Content>Research by the Desert Knowledge CRC corroborates the notion of dual systems in relation to technical functions undertaken within remote community life, which tend to be divided along gender lines, but with some tasks shared by both sexes. In their 2008 paper, ‘Housing for livelihoods: The lifecycle of housing and infrastructure through a whole-of-system approach in remote Aboriginal settlements’, researchers Seeman, Parnell, McFallan and Tucker identify a series of activities (see Figure 4 in Appendix 3) as being predominantly women’s technical functions, some – such as washing and repairing clothes – of which relate directly to the domestic sphere, while others—teaching and education, health, administration, arts and crafts—are less strongly linked, possibly because they have been introduced through Western contact.</Content>

    <Content> As well as the cultural precedent for higher levels of mobility amongst young men, the lack of employment and training opportunities connected with male-associated technical functions may partly explain their infrequent presence at the computers. In addition to the domestic location of the desktop computers, participants may also have perceived the ICT skills and training opportunities (discussed in Chapter 3) we offered during the project to be more aligned with women’s technical functions and typical occupations. For example, one husband’s comments (above) about wanting his wife to write administrative reports for him about the cattle project suggests that he may have seen this ‘home office’ use of the computer as more part of her domain of technical activity, but complementary to his cattle work within a male domain of external activity. Merlan observes that: ‘Women’s productive and especially redistributive role was important in defining Aboriginal domesticity, and the current membership of particular domestic groups.’</Content>

    <Content> A couple of years after we installed the computers in the communities, men’s rate of participation in surveys and discussions on our research trips had declined to just under one-third (29 per cent). With only a few exceptions, when men interacted with us, it was often as a member of a couple or a family group, and they were generally less forthcoming than the women present. The women occasionally mentioned some young men – brothers, nephews, grandsons – using the computers, with a couple of women in their 20s once reporting that their 16-year-old nephew had shown them how to do things on the computer. When we asked Mary on one occasion whether the ‘young fellas use the computers’, she replied, ‘Yeah, they use them. They help me use the computers’, which may suggest that young men used the ICTs and helped others with them more than was evident when we were in the communities.</Content>

    <Content>Women’s greater rate of participation (71 per cent) was likely to have been influenced by the fact that we were a majority of women, and interacting with us was therefore possibly considered the responsibility of the women. The greater numbers of women mentioned as frequent computer users may also reflect gender peer group dynamics: that is, not only did more women participate in the field research, but they tended to cite themselves and their female contemporaries more often as users (as in the responses to the question in the previous section about who looked after the computer, where each gender tended to report use by its members more often). Therefore, although our interactions with the outstation residents suggested a gender-coding of spaces, roles and activities associated with computer use, we do not consider these to be conclusive results.</Content>

    <Content>In early 2012, CAYLUS, in conjunction with the Papunya community, set up a Kungkas’ (or women’s) room alongside the main computer room in response to the perception that the PCR was largely a young male space. The Kungkas’ room, a ‘lounge’-style space with books and toys, where mothers could bring children while they used the computers, was intended to provide a location where women would feel comfortable about accessing the computers, as well as addressing the overflow of users from the main room. A female community development worker was engaged to undertake self-directed learning with young women in the Kungkas’ room.</Content>

    <Content>At the time of our visit to Papunya in May 2012, the Kunkgas’ room had only been open for several months, and there weren’t any significant increases in female computer users. It did not appear to have gained sufficient momentum yet to change perceptions about who felt comfortable using the computer facility. Some female non-users in the community, most of whom were middle-aged or older, told us they were unaware of the Kungkas’ room’s existence, which suggests the computing facility continued to be associated more with youth activities.</Content>

    <Content>When we spoke to CAYLUS a year later, they reported that while there were approximately seventy users per day at the Papunya Computer Room, use of the Kungkas' room tended to wax and wane, often according to whether female support workers were present. They also said that some boys had been entering the Kungkas' room and ‘getting flirty’ with the girls, but that local Papunya female staff members were unable to get the boys to leave, because of inter-family relationships. PCR and CAYLUS staff also observed that certain family relationships, as well as age and gender groups, could influence who felt comfortable using the computer room, similar to how access to the Women’s Centre computers at Imangara became largely restricted to one family. CAYLUS suggested that some white support staff would probably always be involved in managing the computer room, because of the need to take into account cultural constraints relating to gender and family affiliations.</Content>

    <Content>In September 2013, the PCR underwent a further evolution when it was re-located in the Maku Shed (further discussed in Chapter 9, ‘Alternative Regimes’). Originally, a small room in the Maku Shed was set aside for Kungkas only, but it proved difficult for the coordinator to supervise along with the main room, and was closed after two of its computer screens were damaged. The coordinator did not think, however, that gender was as significant an issue in the Maku Shed as in the original PCR building, because it was a larger space and harder for the men to dominate, although she thought that avoidance relationships still needed to be managed.</Content>

    <Content>The Papunya experience indicates that one drawback of a shared facility arrangement such as a computer center or kiosk is its capacity to be patronized by a particular group to the exclusion of other sections of the local community. In the case of the original PCR, the greater presence of young men in the main room discouraged other groups, such as women and older people, from using the computers. Consequently, cultural constraints relating to gender and family affiliations, whereby members of the opposite sex and certain family groupings cannot occupy the same space, shaped the planning of successive versions of the computer room, particularly in regard to space and staffing arrangements.</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Contrary to the expectations of international literature, and the experience of shared facilities at Papunya and Ali Curung, women engaged more substantially in ICT use in the outstations. This outcome suggests household-based ICT arrangements might preference women as users, given their associations with domestic space and administrative tasks (although this evidence was perhaps distorted by the majority female composition of our research team). It raises the possibility, however, that locating computers and internet access within household space might lead to stronger association of digital technology with a female-coded domain and technical activities, with positive flow-on effects in facilitating greater ICT usage by women and children. This is a significant benefit of providing ICT access on a household basis, extending women’s educational and creative opportunities, as well as assisting with the practical aspects of their lives. Overall, the unintentional age and gender biases associated with the location of computers and internet access in both the outstation trial and the PCR indicate the need to consider Aboriginal cultural norms and behavior in regard to gender, age and avoidance relationships in providing ICT infrastructure and arrangements, as well as training and technical support, to facilitate equality of access in remote Aboriginal communities.</Content>

    <Content>The outstation residents’ encounters with satellite internet, as recounted in previous chapters, was aided and shaped by our efforts. Assistance with software downloads and passwords, the cables, ink and spare parts we provided, our dealings with installers, and a myriad of other small tasks, impacted on the residents’ experience of the internet. The Home Internet Project thus involved what can be considered a unique ‘terms of use’ – albeit a consultative one – in that those who took part knowingly agreed to our involvement, and were given a set of choices and a level of guidance. In the process we observed, and were brought into, the social dimensions of computing and internet use that emerged.</Content>

    <Content>The question that arises is the extent to which different arrangements for technology, provisioning and support might have resulted in a different level of engagement or experience of the internet. As mentioned in Chapter 1, a number of programs attempting to deliver internet access have been implemented in remote communities since the 1990s. These have produced highly-varied levels of infrastructure, facilities and technological approaches across different communities. A small number of larger communities have also received the kinds of infrastructure and telecommunication services widely available in metropolitan and regional areas, such as mobile broadband and ADSL. In this chapter, we discuss the resulting patchwork of internet access, and discuss the pros and cons of the various models.</Content>

    <Content>We also examine how each of these arrangements impacts on issues of affordability, the different retail mechanisms they offer (where relevant), and the ongoing costs of maintaining networks and equipment. As shown in Part II, the spatial and social dimensions of internet access change according to whether the internet is accessed in public or domestic spaces, and whether these arrangements favor certain groups of users, or encourage use of a particular type of device. Some of the programs that have been implemented in remote communities provide free access, whereas others involve particular retail mechanisms (explored further in Chapter 9). An important issue is the sustainability of these various regimes, and whether they encourage reliance on outside agencies and providers through subsidies and maintenance arrangements, or rely primarily on commercial providers.</Content>

Even within this relatively short timeframe, the PCR underwent a series of significant transitions in adapting to available ICT, including the introduction of mobile coverage, and in attempting to meet the needs of the community.

The computer room relied chiefly on a series of volunteers on short-term contracts to provide administrative and training/mentoring to community members who use its facilities. Use of the computers and equipment was free, so as not to discourage any community members from using the facility.

    <Content>The main use of computers at the PCR was as a form of entertainment, rather than for communication administrative activities or formal education. Collaborative and creative industries activities featured more significantly at the PCR, but were non-existent in the project communities, which reflects the relative capacity and sophistication of the PCR and the community’s connections with creative enterprises, such as the Papunya-Tula and Papunya Tjupi arts movements, and well-known local bands such as the Warumpi Band and the Tjupi Band. Use of the internet for administrative purposes was lower than on the outstations. While some community members used computers for online shopping, relatively few people undertook tasks such as accessing banking and online services and resources on the PCR terminals. However, there was less need to use the internet at Papunya to contact service agencies, given the presence of government services and organizations such as the Central Land Council (CLC) and the Congress Aboriginal Health Service within the community. When we interviewed PCR staff in 2014, they said that the computers were still being used mainly for entertainment, although Facebook had emerged as a new significant usage. While the coordinator had ‘set up a lot of online banking and things like that’, people generally accessed bank and Centrelink accounts at terminals available for those purposes at the community store, the Centrelink and Shire offices at Papunya.</Content>

    <Content>In September 2013, the PCR transitioned to the Maku Shed, a multi-purpose hub that provides a range of social engagement activities for the community. The Maku Shed is a large Nissen hut at Papunya, which had been re-purposed as a men’s social club with pool tables and large screens for watching sport. The computers were moved into the Maku Shed to provide additional activities as part of an overarching exercise in community development that sought to take the computer room to the next level as a self-sufficient enterprise. It was also fuelled by the need to find a larger space for the computer facility, and to support other popular community activities, such as a cooking and nutrition program, and to address the long-term sustainability of the PCR, which had been surviving on a patchwork of philanthropic funds sourced by the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service (CAYLUS).</Content>

Internet and computer use at the Maku Shed was made available on a ticketing system, priced from $0.50 to $1, with tickets supplied by the Northern Territory Remote Indigenous Public Internet Access (RIPIA). Soft drinks and evening meals were also sold.

The computers were popular with primary school-age kids and teenagers after school, with 17-30-year olds being their main users at night. Consequently, older adults, especially those who were working, were less likely to use the computers. The Maku Shed supervisor commented: ‘There are so many kids in here, from 3:30 to 6 pm; it's so intense the adults don't want to be in here.’ It was rare for anyone over 60 to use the Maku Shed, although middle-aged community members occasionally visited.</Content>

We also heard of this occuring in other communities where shared internet facilities were operating. However, the Maku Shed supervisor thought that avoidance relationships had proved to be less of an issue with the move of the shared facility into a larger space, suggesting that it was more likely that particular family members would commandeer the computer in smaller spaces, including households. She gave an example of a family who’d had a computer at home, but had ended up coming to the Maku Shed because one person had monopolized use of the computer. By contrast, the emphasis of the Maku Shed was ‘more about sharing with community’, rather than being family-oriented. People even came to the Maku Shed to ‘sit on the couch, using their phones because it's a lot more exciting than being at home’.</Content>

    <Content>CAYLUS and PCR staff mooted that whitefella involvement would always be necessary at a remote community computer facility, because of kinship obligations and avoidance relationships (‘Family relationships get the better of people, because of the level of humbug from kids and so on’). However, greater engagement of community members of both sexes and from different family groups, including autonomously for short periods of time, occurred with the transition to a larger space at the Maku Shed, along with the development of greater ICT skills amongst community members over time. A team of ten local residents supported the Maku Shed supervisor in overseeing use of the computers, but also in running the facility when she was absent from Papunya. In order to deal with any avoidance relationship issues, a male and a female, usually a member of one of the community’s prominent families and someone from another family, were normally left in charge of the Maku Shed.</Content>

That's when people are most active around here as well, particularly in summer.’ She stressed that, in providing training to remote community members, it was necessary ‘to be flexible with time. And be really opportunistic. Just grab people when you can. Form those relationships with people so they'll want to attend your class, rather than just say when it's on’. The need for flexibility, along with an individual focus and the development of relationships with community members to understand their learning needs, also accords with aspects of our experience of delivering training to communities in the project.</Content>

Community members also perceived a lack of purpose to the organized training delivered at Papunya – that it was unlikely to provide a pathway to local employment. ‘People have been trained in a thousand things’, the PCR co-ordinator observed, ‘but there's no capacity to work [for employment – i.e. very few jobs available locally].’ Likewise, the trainers delivering courses generally did not canvas what community members wished to learn, how they wished to learn, or build relationships through which they might gain some idea of people’s learning needs.</Content>

    <Content>Of the ICT access models available, the shared facility approach, of which the PCR/Maku Shed is the most highly developed, offers the lowest implementation costs, because all the facilities are centralized and shared. However, the operational costs can be very high.

    <Content>The access center model will always be constrained by the need for the security of the facility and the availability of a supervisor, and for these reasons most centers only open during business hours, and sometimes for only a few days per week. Supervision brings the obvious benefit that a skilled person is on hand to assist users in using unfamiliar applications, providing ICT training, and solving particular support problems. The access center can also be an effective vehicle for supporting school-based computing activities, provided there is effective collaboration between the schoolteachers and the center supervisor. However, subsidizing the costs associated with engaging a supervisor can be difficult. While these supervisory positions are often staffed by one or more volunteers to reduce costs, that approach introduces a greater than normal administrative overhead to recruit, orientate and manage volunteers who may only stay in the community for one or two months. In the transition from the PCR to the Maku Shed, introducing a fee-for-access model and sales of small items, was insufficient to support a supervisor’s salary, and funds had to be sourced from other community development enterprises within Papunya – an arrangement unlikely to be feasible in a minor community.</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Since the Home Internet Project commenced, another ICT option has been introduced into the remote Northern Territory Aboriginal context: access to community WiFi points and networks. One of the first versions of this approach accompanied the development of the solar-powered satellite community phone in 2009 by APN (the owners of ISP Activ8) for use at small outstations in remote areas. Approximately 300 of these Commonwealth government-funded phones are now in service at remote locations with a population of less than fifty people, and have all been enhanced to provide WiFi access points. This arrangement operates on a ‘BYOD’ (Bring Your Own Device) basis in which individual users supply their own WiFi-equipped laptop, tablet or smartphone computing device to connect to the internet. In 2014, one of the women in Imangara told us she had been using one of these WiFi points when visiting a family outstation. She was very pleased that it was available.</Content>

    <Content>Most versions of the Community WiFi model implemented in remote communities to date are similar to the enhanced solar-powered satellite community phone one, insofar as they are BYOD and consist of a single WiFi access point, which concentrates all ICT users, and hence traffic, around a single point and internet source in the community. But unless the community is small (for example, a family-sized outstation), a single domestic National Broadband Network (NBN) satellite service is unlikely to have the capacity to provide sufficient broadband speed for all the users who may wish to connect simultaneously. WiFi is technically limited to a radius of about 50 meters from the access point, and coverage typically diminishes further with obstacles such as vegetation and building walls (particularly metal-clad walls) in the way, making use within community buildings and houses unreliable. The larger the community, the more access points are needed to provide realistic coverage, particularly if equity of access for all residents is to be ensured.</Content>

The spatial consequences of WiFi – how and where individuals access the internet – is an area that requires further investigation. For instance, in April 2015, CAYLUS called for free WiFi to be installed in Alice Springs town camps as a diversionary activity for young people (2015b). A news article quoted Nicholas Williams, a youth worker at CAYLUS, observing that before WiFi was available in Hermannsburg, kids were more likely to be ‘breaking in areas, hanging around where they’re not supposed to’.</Content>

    <Content>An example of a community WiFi network which seeks to respond to equity of access issues is that at Milyakburra, a remote settlement on Bickerton Island. This arrangement was set up under the Commonwealth government-funded RIPIA scheme, which at the time was mostly supporting ICT access via library facilities in Northern Territory Top End communities; however, RIPIA installed a WiFi network at Milyakburra because it was so small that it lacked a library or other suitable community building. The network consisted of two wireless access points installed on high points (the roof of the business center and a centrally-located radio mast) within the community, and in-home wireless repeaters were installed in each dwelling so that internet access could be extended to premises at the edge of the community, thus ensuring equity of access on a household basis. Reports from the Northern Territory RIPIA scheme indicated that WiFi access at hubs such as libraries in Top End communities were likewise well-patronized, day and night, by users with mobile devices inside or outside the buildings.</Content>

    <Content>In order to access WiFi hotspots, residents need mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets or laptops. However, the prices of iPads, laptops and other mobile devices can be prohibitive if bought at community stores rather than at electronics shops in regional centers and cities. We observed a number of people purchasing devices on rent-to-buy plans, spending as much as $1,500 in total on an iPad in 2013. The expense and lack of availability of such devices in some very remote locations could undermine the social inclusiveness of this model.</Content>

    <Content>As Ali Curung is only a twenty-minute drive from Imangara, we were struck by the comparatively high rates of internet use in this larger town, given that Imangara had such low rates when we commenced our research. There were two possible explanations: either Ali Curung, and possibly other communities, had experienced a sudden rise in internet use since 2010, or factors particular to Ali Curung were influencing people’s decision to use the internet. If most people in Ali Curung had started using the internet in recent years, is it possible that Imangara would have done so without our involvement? Both communities have a similar socio-economic profile, suggesting that affordability was not the reason for the difference, even though Imangara residents had indicated that ‘money’ was a reason they did not have internet connections at the start of the project. Some Imangara residents appeared to spend time in Ali Curung on occasion (one Imangara resident relocated to Ali Curung during the course of our research), suggesting that some level of knowledge transfer between the communities was likely.</Content>

    <Content>We asked the residents of Ali Curung how long they had been using the internet or had owned particular devices, and found that 65 per cent of users had first started using the internet three years ago or less. Ali Curung received mobile phone reception prior to 2009, and mobile phones were the most common means of accessing the internet: 67.4 per cent of those interviewed owned a mobile phone (or possibly had easy access to a family member’s), and 57 per cent of those were using their mobile phone to access the internet. However, when asked, ‘How long have you had a mobile phone for?’, 60 per cent told us that they had possessed a mobile phone for three years or less, suggesting that smart phone adoption and internet use through the mobile phone had occurred in recent years in Ali Curung, and somewhat rapidly. Only 32 per cent of people had owned a mobile for between five and ten years, while just over 5 per cent had owned a mobile phone for more than ten years. Tablet devices were reasonably popular with just over 30 per cent of people in possession of one. However, 70 per cent of those who had a tablet device had owned it for six months or less. Of the forty-five houses, seven had a desktop computer, only one of which was connected to the internet by a USB 3G mobile broadband stick modem. No households had a satellite internet connection. In addition, thirteen people were using the desktop computer at the Shire office, but only for Centrelink and internet banking. Nineteen people (22 per cent) told us that they had a laptop computer, although some of these may have been shared.</Content>

    <Content>Importantly, none of those who were using the internet at the time were paying for the internet through post-paid billing. All who were paying for the internet (forty-five in total) were purchasing pre-paid mobile broadband credit, which was available for purchase at the store. The decision to choose pre-paid over post-paid plans enables people to avoid the bill shock experienced by Mr Namayiwa in the above example. One consequence that we observed in the Ali Curung study is that people are regularly without internet when their pre-paid credit expires, and some were topping up credit frequently. Sharing of devices, and hence sharing of credit, appeared to be common. One-third of those with an internet connection stated that they sometimes shared the cost with others.</Content>

    <Content>So as it turns out, internet use in Ali Curung was probably much lower in 2010 when our first interviews in Imangara were occurring. However, when we analyzed the evidence from the Ali Curung study in relation to the broader findings of the home internet project, we concluded that Imangara might not have experienced the sudden rise in internet adoption in the absence of an assistance program. Without deliberate substitutes (including initiatives such as community WiFi or the assistance offered by us in the outstations), the way in which mobile broadband is sold, as well as the simplicity of connectivity through mobile broadband devices, circumvents some of the obstacles we observed in relation to satellite internet on the outstations. In Chapter 9, we discuss further the ‘digital choices’ being made in remote communities, and provide a theoretical framework for thinking through the unevenness of internet access between communities and regions.</Content>

The invention was to become the Centre for Appropriate Technology’s (CAT’s) mobile hotspots project. Each hotspot consists of a re-purposed domestic satellite dish, which is used to amplify a nearby mobile signal. The structure uses no power or software to operate, and needs no maintenance, requiring only to be placed at a suitable height within the (extended) range.

It is also worth noting that although companies such as Endaga provide phone numbers and interconnection to service providers, in 2015 the wholesale price of a single phone number (purchased by the service provider and presumably factored into call charges) is currently six times that of a phone number in the US, and incurs incoming call costs. Therefore, although microtelcos could emerge in remote Australia, providing a competitive call charge rate to consumers could be a challenge.</Content>

    <Content>As discussed in Chapter 1, Australia’s Universal Obligation provides subsidies to the Universal Service Obligations (USO) provider (Telstra) for standard telephone services and payphones only. As Stuart Corner writes, when the Labor government made changes to the USO 2012 (in order to accommodate the NBN), many believed that an opportunity for radical reform was missed, including the possibility of a USO that would take account of the ‘popularity and reliance on mobile telephony’.</Content>

    <Content> The various scenarios outlined above, including computer centers and public WiFi, are attempts to provide some means of access in conditions of market failure. Public WiFi, which in other contexts is a transitory solution for people when away from home and work, is intended as a first level of service in some remote communities, making up for the lack of fibre optic and mobile broadband infrastructure. Remote communities, such as the Maku Shed in Papunya, have been experimenting with how to make public WiFi sustainable. However, there is no clear path to ensuring that WiFi or mobile broadband are possible in communities of all sizes, or how these might tie in with existing infrastructure and legislative technologies such as the NBN and the USO.</Content>

    <Content>In 2010 we presented the outstation residents with a list of reasons that might explain why they had not already purchased internet subscriptions, based on what they had told us in earlier consultations. We then asked them to rank the reasons in order of significance. The greatest barrier to internet adoption turned out to be what we, for the sake of language simplicity, had called ‘no cash/too costly/$’. Other reasons included ‘Not important’; ‘No-one to help fix them’; ‘Don’t know how to use it’; ‘English too hard to read’ (we verbally explained the list for those for whom English was indeed too hard to read). By the end of the project when residents were given the option to maintain the internet at their own expense, ‘no cash’ emerged again as the major factor. However, ‘no cash’ was not necessarily just a matter of affordability, but of a more complex and intertwined set of issues to do with the flow of money within and out of the community, time-specific spending priorities, and – most importantly – the difficulties of paying for internet and navigating payment systems. Some of the other barriers identified at the start of the project were also likely to have related to the broad category of money, such as poor English language inhibiting people from understanding the various contracts on offer.</Content>

    <Content>Thus the problem of money was not necessarily a matter of what one was prepared to pay, but of how things were paid for. As discussed in the previous chapter, satellite broadband was available at cheaper rates than mobile broadband in Ali Curung, and yet none of the households we spoke to (half of all houses in that community) had a satellite internet subscription at the time, while around 70 per cent of people had mobile broadband. Not everyone managed to maintain a prepaid mobile broadband all the time, which indicates that affordability was indeed an issue. However, it was clear that people were willing to pay for the internet when they could, but only under circumstances that suited them.</Content>

    <Content>The concept of the digital divide is based on the idea that consumer choice alone will not create an equitable society (see Chapter 2). However, what if the choices on offer – including the retail mechanism and devices – were to change or expand? Some of these offerings might meet the needs of those who were formerly not able, or not inclined, to adopt. Moreover, once some people acquire the internet, they may influence others to do the same. In this chapter, we explore the social dimensions of ‘digital choices’ in relation to the digital divide in remote Australia. In the final part of the chapter, we provide a theory to explain the digital divide in remote Australia, which we call ‘the demic dealbreaker’, expanding on economic choice theory to take into account how the sociality of place and network effects can lead entire communities and groups to adopt or not to adopt. The theory provides a means for thinking through different arrangements and policy approaches that may help to resolve the digital divide in remote Australia.</Content>

    <Content>In the case of Indigenous Australia, it is possible to draw a correlation between the digital divide and disadvantage. A series of studies by the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research has found that, overall, Indigenous people living in urban and town locations are better off than those living in remote areas. In all parts of the country (remote and non-remote, with a significant Indigenous population), Indigenous people were also found to be worse off than non-Indigenous Australians living nearby across a range of socio-economic measures, including educational attainment, income, labor force participation and housing.</Content>

          <Content>Peculiarities in the data relating to the type of internet connection are likely to have been the result of the way in which the survey was administered. The census is completed in remote communities with the assistance of ABS staff, who administer the survey door-to-door, whereas elsewhere it is completed by household members either online or on paper. The census asked residents what type of internet connection was available at the dwelling. The options included ‘broadband’, ‘dial-up’ and ‘other’, with an explanatory note that ‘other’ includes ‘internet access through mobile phones etc’. However, in Santa Teresa, a community with mobile coverage, no dwellings were identified as having an ‘other’ internet connection, while thirty houses chose ‘not stated’. In Yuendumu, twenty-seven houses stated that they had an ‘other’ connection and only three were not stated. There are a number of possible explanations for these inconsistencies, including whether the question was adequately explained to the participant, as well as confusion as to whether individual access to the internet via a mobile device is considered to belong to a dwelling or not. Despite these discrepancies, when grouped into ILOCs with mobile coverage and those without, the differences in internet adoption appear to be statistically significant.</Content>

    <Content> As Indigenous households in many of these communities share a similar socio-economic profile, we can conclude that social exclusion is not necessarily the cause of digital exclusion. Even when money is tight, we found that many people are prepared to pay for the internet when they have experienced it on an ongoing basis. Internet adoption is not ‘determined’ by one’s socio-economic status, but can be a choice that is made when various factors of convenience and motivation are weighed up. The reasons underpinning the decision to purchase internet services, and the circumstances that inform that choice, are intricately tied up in contemporary and traditional obligations and patterns, and the pressures and preoccupations of daily life. We return to this point at the end of the chapter, discussing how the decisions of some can, through network effects, slow down internet adoption for the community or group. First, however, it is necessary to examine the ‘digital choices’ informing internet adoption in remote communities.</Content>

    <Content>When we drove into the community, Mary hurried out onto her verandah and said there’d been 'worry about the internet'. She was particularly concerned about not being able to access her bank account. We then talked to another woman, Louise, who told us that her internet connection was still working – she’d been checking Westpac and Gumtree but she hadn't been able to use her email account. She produced a letter she’d received from the internet service provider (ISP), which she didn’t understand, and showed it to us. The letter was dated four months previously, and it said that the ISP had changed her password to protect her privacy, and that she would have to ring them to get the new one. She also told us that Emily’s WiFi wasn't working; she wasn't sure why, but she thought Emily mightn’t have paid the bill.</Content>

    <Content>We weren’t totally surprised by these developments, because co-author Andrew had noticed problems with payment of some accounts before we’d left Alice Springs. Mary had also rung him a couple of times, wanting to know what had happened to her internet access. When we stopped off at the store near Imangara, the storekeeper told us she thought some community members’ accounts had lapsed after three months because they hadn’t paid their bills. She observed that most people in the community seemed to spend their money quickly, on or just after ‘payday’, when they received either wages or social security payments. The older people in particular tended to swipe through as many purchases as possible, often for younger family members, until their available credit was exhausted. The absence of money in their accounts so soon after payday would also explain why so many of the ISP’s direct debits bounced, because the monthly billing date would not necessarily coincide with the fortnightly wage and social security payments community members received.</Content>

    <Content>We encountered a similar situation at Mungalawurru the next morning. One family had been using their computer to lodge their Centrelink forms until one day in February, when the internet had stopped working. The husband had intended to submit his form that day, but lodged it in town instead because ‘the internet was closed’. They’d tried a neighbour’s house but the internet was not working there either. 'Everyone's using the phone now’ to lodge their Centrelink forms, the wife told us. When we rang the ISP later, they confirmed that they would give customers three months' grace to pay bills before cutting them off. Payments had been going through to their account for a time, but when the payments stopped, the ISP eventually cut them off.</Content>

    <Content>In the afternoon, we drove back to Imangara and organized a meeting at the Women’s Centre the next day, so people could ring the ISP and sort out their billing situation. It had been raining heavily in the Barkly the week before our visit, and people were more comfortable sitting outside the Centre on plastic chairs rather than clustering around a telephone booth in the mud. A group of people joined us, and Andrew rang the ISP. He told the support person that we were ringing from a remote community in the Northern Territory, then put one of the residents on the phone. She had had problems reading the original letter from the ISP; it wasn’t clear whether this was because of sight or literacy issues, or a combination of both. The ISP representative gave the woman an email ID and a new password, which Andrew recorded for her. Another woman spoke to the ISP about her billing situation and the debt on her account. When we’d spoken to her the previous day, it wasn’t clear whether she realized her internet connection had stopped working because she hadn’t paid, or for some other technical reason.

We weren’t sure whether Mary would run with this idea, but she said, ‘No, it’s not fair’, and, nodding at her grandson, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll deal with this’. She addressed him in language; he looked uncomfortable, but agreed that he would make a contribution to the bill. Mary wanted to alternate the direct debit payments between herself and the grandson on a monthly basis, but we told her this wouldn’t be possible, and that he’d have to organize a transfer from his account or pay her $20 in cash per month.

    <Content>The immediate change for householders after the transition was the need to pay for their own individual internet accounts. However, since the services and facilities were already in place in the communities, affordability was not such a major factor, because the actual amounts people chose to pay for internet plans were fairly modest ($3540 per month). Generally, those households who prioritized ICT access were likely to be able to find the resources to keep an individual internet service operational, even though it was not subsidized. Residents were also aware of the costs associated with appliances and energy consumption, and knew that computer usage could increase their power bills (already averaging around $50 a month). This awareness of the need to manage increased household service costs was also reflected by some residents’ attempts to limit other community members’ and visitors’ computer and internet access through the use of passwords, and thus control their power bills.</Content>

    <Content>Despite the willingness of some community members to allocate a portion of household budgets to internet services, navigating and managing the ISP’s billing mechanisms proved problematic for them. About half the householders struggled over the first six months to maintain sufficient balances in their nominated bank accounts to support the monthly payments when they became due, resulting in temporary loss of internet access in some cases, and much larger withdrawals when the accrued fee was eventually debited. While in theory the ISP offers a pre-paid account option that might relieve this situation, it requires payment for six months’ usage in advance, which is too high a lump sum payment for remote community residents operating on very low incomes. One obvious improvement would be a ‘pay by the Gigabyte’ pre-paid satellite broadband option, analogous to the well-established pre-paid SIM option for mobile phones, which would overcome the need to involve the customer’s financial institution in both the application process and monthly billing. However, in our conversations with retail service providers, we learnt that such arrangements are thwarted by the way in which they are required to purchase satellite capacity from the wholesaler, the National Broadband Network (NBNCo).</Content>

    <Content> These internet services have since fallen into disuse after families defaulted on payment for broadband plans. Households were unable to pay the bills because their resources were spread too thinly amongst a large number of highly-mobile residents, making regular payment almost impossible. As in the post-transition phase at the communities, these residents struggled with the administrative processes required to terminate the direct debit arrangements, because of the level of ‘English legalese’ needed to negotiate with service providers. Some people who signed up for direct debit for internet plan charges were still being billed, even though they no longer received a service. There was no onsite or external expertise available to repair or replace any computer equipment that was damaged. Essentially, this household computing arrangement languished because of a lack of ongoing IT technical support to assist community members with maintenance and administrative issues. The only conclusion to draw from these experiences is that subsidies for satellite broadband connection in remote areas are not sufficient to support ongoing home computer and internet access for remote Aboriginal communities without external assistance for the installation process, and for more complex technical and maintenance support issues.</Content>

Instead, the trend was towards discrete family/household, even highly-personalized use of the PCs, even those situated in shared, public spaces. Additionally, as the trial progressed, there was increasing recognition of personal ownership, particularly as people became more aware that the financial costs of maintaining the ICT and internet access were being borne by the owners.

As discussed in Chapter 2, we experienced some arduous processes when setting up the accounts ourselves. The technical team’s facilitation of the application for NBNCo Interim Satellite Service (ISS) services, and their implementation on behalf of twelve households, was also a resource-intensive experience. Each instance required a mixture of online, postal, text message, email, and phone transactions, including obtaining the householder’s signatures for the registration, service application and payment forms. While the majority of such transactions proceeded smoothly, they required regular liaison between the facilitator, the customer and the provider to ensure that the customer would be at home when signatures were needed, or when the installer was due to arrive onsite. It is unlikely that the residents would have been successful in carrying out the various steps required for the transition to occur with their limited telecommunications options and knowledge of the processes, combined with the NBNCo and ISP staff’s relatively uninformed perceptions of remote community realities.</Content>

    <Content>A further example of the communication issues that can emerge between ISPs and remote community residents was the confusion caused by the password changes the ISP made to the residents’ email accounts after the transition. The residents’ applications for their new internet services during the transition included the technical team’s contact details for coordinating the installation process; the technical team members then informed the residents of their new email addresses and passwords. However, a couple of months after the transition occurred, the ISP decided that the provision of these passwords to the technical team was a security breach, because the team members were ‘not authorised contacts for the residents’. Consequently, the ISP unilaterally changed most of the passwords, cutting the technical team, and therefore the residents, most of whom could not be contacted except by post, out of the dialogue. Despite now having their new internet service, the residents could not use email, and could not access their online account details to make contact with the ISP. A letter arrived in the post from the ISP some time later advising them to phone in for their new password, but this left most residents in a state of confusion. Even Louise, who had more facility and confidence in relating to whitefellas and their forms of administration than most other participants, struggled to understand the letter, because of the level of ‘legalese’ used.</Content>

The series of actions that ISPs require customers to go through to obtain satellite broadband service and manage payment of an internet plan is reasonably straightforward if the customer is readily contactable by phone, has a good grasp of English, and has sufficient knowledge about broadband services to be able to make an informed choice of service plan.

Without this support, the relative smallness of remote Indigenous communities, along with their geographical isolation and differences in language and culture, would likely render these populations largely invisible to government policymakers and service providers. In the case of telecommunications providers, the invisibility of remote Indigenous populations, and the limited demand they represent as a consumer base, means they are unlikely to address even relatively simple communication and administrative barriers to ICT take-up. In other words, there is little incentive for telecommunications providers to develop financial and administrative services and processes tailored to capturing this market, except without invoking goodwill platforms such as ‘equity of access’, ‘global citizenship’ and ‘social inclusion’.</Content>

    <Content>Our qualitative work, as well as our analysis of the 2011 census data for the region, suggests that it is not necessarily attitudes to technologies that are influencing digital choices in remote Indigenous communities, but the conditions under which technologies are made accessible. When remote Indigenous sociality is taken into account, the choice to purchase mobile broadband or nothing (i.e. the absence of substitution at the margin) makes sense. Factors such as difficulties with billing systems, inconvenience in dealing with retail providers (related to language barriers, or lack of other infrastructures such as home phones) are significant reasons to stay offline.</Content>

    <Content>The economic choice theory of characteristic filtering (also known as behavioural lexicographical choice theory) describes instances where choosers set targets for particular characteristics, and eliminate products that don’t meet those targets completely. In other words, the chooser decides: ‘If x does not do y then I will not have anything at all’, deciding that the missing characteristic is too important to substitute for something else; for the chooser the missing piece is the deal-breaker. The theory is useful for explaining some instances where choosers do not appear to be maximizing their outcomes – choosing to discount seemingly adequate options.</Content>

    <Content>Two further concepts are useful for expanding on choice theory to explain how the ‘deal-breaker’ all-or-nothing decision can result in exclusion of an entire group or community. Firstly, in the broadest sense, Indigenous communities, like all communities, are a knowledge group, whereby the group shares its information, stories and culture, forming a particular set of social norms and influencing knowledge flows. Hartley and Potts (2014) call these ‘we’ groups demes (stemming from the Greek ‘demos’, meaning polity). The ‘demic’ aspect of the ‘deal-breaker’ scenario describes the way in which the decision only makes sense when seen in relation to group actions, norms and knowledge-sharing systems. We, the authors, had lengthy discussions as to the extent to which cultural norms are a significant factor in internet adoption, or whether practical issues (such as ability to call the ISP) are the main reason for the choices being made. While we did not reach an agreement on the specifics, as previous chapters have highlighted, life in Indigenous communities involves particular dynamics and ways of doing that influence ICT adoption and use generally.</Content>

<ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle="ParagraphStyle/Paragraph">
  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Secondly, at the individual level, the decision not to adopt can be based on the decision-maker’s circumstances, or attributable to a range of factors, including whether others in the group are using digital technologies. For some, no obvious decision is made, but they might accept the status quo based upon what others are doing or not doing. Those who might have little or no digital skills (for instance, those residents who went to school prior to the introduction of computers in classrooms) are unlikely to receive the information required to consider internet adoption unless those they know share it with them. Therefore, if those who might be considered (comparatively) early adopters choose not to purchase the internet – or choose only to use it in town, for instance – then other potential users do not get exposed to the technology.</Content>

    <Content> Granovetter argues that our acquaintances – weak social ties – are more likely to give us new information than our close friends and family, as those who we know already share similar knowledge. For Indigenous communities, it is entirely possible that adoption doesn’t begin to occur and spread until an outsider (for instance, a youth worker) assists some people within the community with the means to acquire internet. This might also apply to those who understand that satellite internet is available, but have decided that it is too difficult to acquire, but those who have no knowledge of it will remain in the dark. Dense community ties can therefore restrict information, and be an obstacle to technology diffusion and development more generally.</Content>

    <Content>As discussed in Chapter 2, digital exclusion – like social exclusion – needs to be understood in terms of the causal process. During our time on the outstations, it also became apparent that digital exclusion is not a clear-cut case of ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’. Some residents were not using the internet as the result of a considered choice. For instance, the man who ran the youth project in Kwale Kwale was disinclined to use a computer, but he took up our offer to have one at his place, as other people who assisted him on the project were able to use it. He still experienced the benefits, and it is likely that the computer enabled other capacities (for him and others) flowing from a more efficient management of the records of the youth service. Such instances show there are gradations of use, including those, known as proxy users, who choose to access online services with the help of others.</Content>

    <Content>When the digital divide is seen as a matter of digital choice rather than social exclusion, policies and programs can emerge that provide acceptable systems or incentives for participation. Although the statistics show that internet adoption is higher where there is mobile coverage, unfortunately universal mobile coverage has been deemed too costly by telecommunications companies, and does not fall within current government policy and funding (the Universal Service Obligations [USO], as discussed in Chapter 1). However, alternative billing options for satellite services may increase adoption in areas where mobile is not available. Another response can be the provision of public WiFi in communities (free or through a token system), as discussed in the previous chapter. Understanding digital choices can also help to anticipate what responses are unlikely to succeed, particularly where they do not align with the socially-embedded decision-making that is occurring. For instance, the experience of the outstations in this book suggests that government investment in faster satellite speeds – as has been the focus thus far of the NBN in remote areas – is unlikely in itself to make sufficient difference for Indigenous families living in small, traditional communities, as it does not address the ‘deal-breaker’ problem of account set-up and billing. These policy options are discussed further in the final chapter.</Content>

    <Content>The digital choices being made in remote communities should also give us pause to consider the relationship of digital exclusion to social exclusion. If social exclusion is not the determinant of digital exclusion, then digital exclusion is less intractable than we might otherwise believe. In other words, overcoming digital exclusion does not require resolving Indigenous disadvantage more generally. In an article on Indigenous social exclusion, Boyd Hunter makes the point that when Indigenous social issues are seen through the lens of social exclusion, they appear so interlinked as to seem insolvable: ‘There is a risk that the notions of social inclusion, and to a lesser extent cumulative causation, can lead to a sort of policy nihilism where the magnitude of the task seems too complex and too hard. Unfortunately, there is not much one can do about this if the dimensions of disadvantage are inextricably linked.’</Content>

However, we think that there are solutions to digital exclusion, and that, with time, the broader benefits may begin to take the burden off other services attempting to improve health and education. Our conclusion is therefore ultimately a positive one: the digital divide in remote Australia can be gradually closed, and there are clear strategies for addressing it.

    <Content>The strikingly uneven patterns of internet adoption between remote communities correspond to the availability of mobile broadband and other government programs. Public-private partnerships in some regions have extended mobile coverage to larger remote communities. In addition, various publicly-funded initiatives have provided a level of internet access, including computer rooms and training provided through the Northern Territory Libraries network and remote media organizations. Such programs have been designed to assist Aboriginal people to discover and learn about communication technology within community settings. Community payphones, provided through the former Indigenous Communications Program, are delivering internet to over 300 small communities (with populations under 50 people). The expectation underpinning such programs is that once people are given basic levels of internet skills and experience, they will eventually acquire internet services of their own accord. An unstated assumption is that those living in nearby communities will eventually learn about and adopt internet services through social network effects. However, this is not necessarily the case.</Content>

    <Content>For many in remote communities, internet adoption is not a linear trajectory from non-use to use, but something that people will fall in and out of when coverage and pre-paid credit permit. Affordability is an issue, in that the relative value of internet ICTs is likely to fluctuate depending on an individual’s life circumstances; for example, when money is short, basics such as food, power and transport may take priority rather than fixing a computer/device or paying for subscriptions/data. Particular groups, including older people and those living in small communities, can remain completely excluded, or only experience the benefits of internet use through others (making them users by proxy). Factors such as an individual’s mobility and avoidance relationships can play a role in internet adoption, use and skills transferral.</Content>

    <Content>Households in remote communities are choosing not to acquire satellite broadband services, preferring pre-paid mobile broadband in areas where there is mobile coverage. The consumer preference for pre-paid billing, as well as practical difficulties associated with satellite internet connections, means that households are more likely to go without internet than enter into satellite internet contracts. Our findings suggest that policy objectives aimed at improving internet quality (such as faster speeds), although desirable for services and businesses in remote Australia, will not encourage residents of remote communities to adopt broadband. In this book we have questioned whether satellite internet – the Australian government’s response to internet access in very remote areas – can meet the needs of remote communities under current arrangements. However, changes to the way that satellite internet is sold and supported could make a significant difference, including enabling WiFi programs that provide residents with the payment flexibility they require.</Content>

    <Content>Many of the outstation residents believed there are benefits to being online. Everyday uses such as online banking and shopping can provide a significant level of agency and autonomy for individuals. Checking bank balances and welfare payments emerged as one of the most popular uses of the internet. Internet shopping, entertainment and staying in touch with family via social networking were also common – made more significant when we consider how difficult it can be for those living in remote communities to undertake these activities through other means, given their limited transport and telecommunication options. As very few organizations or agencies attempted to use online communication to reach the residents over the four-year period, we were unable to determine whether internet access can reduce the costs of service provision to outstations.</Content>

    <Content>As discussed in Chapter 9, facilitating the application process for NBNCo Interim Satellite Services (ISS) proved to be time intensive for us. In our view, without such assistance, very few households in remote Indigenous communities would manage to arrange NBN satellite services. It is unrealistic to expect households to carry out the various steps independently, given their limited access to telephones and knowledge of the processes, combined with the NBNCo and (some) ISP staff’s relatively-uninformed perceptions of remote community circumstances.</Content>

Despite the willingness of some community members to allocate a portion of household budgets to internet services, navigating and managing the ISP’s billing mechanisms was difficult. About half the computer owners struggled over the first six months to maintain sufficient balances in their nominated bank accounts to support the monthly payments when they became due, resulting in temporary or permanent loss of internet access in some cases. For others, direct debits of large, unexpected amounts occurred if bills had been unpaid in previous months.</Content>

    <Content>When we commenced the project, there was an assumption in policy and academic analysis that shared facilities were the most appropriate form of internet access for remote communities. In the intervening years, government-funded and NGO programs (including Remote Indigenous Public Internet Access (RIPIA), the community phones project, and work by organizations such as the Central Australian Youth Link Up Service (CAYLUS) have moved increasingly towards public WiFi.</Content>

    <Content>A core focus of our work was whether home internet (the norm for mainstream Australia) was viable, particularly for communities too small to justify telecenters. We also tested shared, community-managed WiFi by placing some computers in communal spaces (at the residents’ request), and monitoring how they were shared and maintained. We considered practical matters to do with housing, including living arrangements, the condition of the houses and whether residents were home often enough to want a permanent connection to the internet; documented how long PCs and related electronics could withstand the heat, dust and vermin; and assessed ownership patterns (both Western ownership and traditional systems of demand sharing).</Content>

  <CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle="$ID/NormalCharacterStyle">
    <Content>Although non-Indigenous people often associate a ‘caring and sharing’ ethic with Aboriginal culture, and therefore assume that shared or communal internet facilities are most appropriate, we found that individuals wanted to identify as the ‘owners’ of the computers. Access, and by extension usage, was largely restricted to the household/immediate family members, with the owner determining who could use the PC. Avoidance relationships between families, and the emphasis on discrete family ownership and use of ICT, resulted in certain family groups often dominating access to computers in shared spaces and excluding others, a finding that was corroborated at the telecenter at Papunya. Location, access and usage are therefore important considerations for remote Aboriginal owners.</Content>

    <Content>These findings have implications in considering models for the provision of ICT and internet access in remote communities. Specifically, telecenter or ‘internet café’-type arrangements which are run by Indigenous community members may not be the most suitable mechanism for providing equitable access to the broader community, owing to family and other cultural obligations (kinship). For example, in one of the larger communities we visited, the death of a young man who had been supervising a computer center meant that some others in that kinship network were unwilling to use it.</Content>

    <Content>While in theory the home computing model provided ICT access for the whole family, ranging from grandparents to young, pre-school children, the dynamics of inter-familial, gender and age relationships influenced community members’ access to and use of the ICTs. The higher profile and level of participation of women in the home computing model suggests that locating computers and internet access within household spaces might lead to a stronger association of digital technology with a female-coded domain and technical activities, with positive flow-on effects in facilitating greater ICT usage by women and children. By contrast, at the Papunya telecenter, the main room became so closely identified with young men that a separate space was created for women to access computers and the internet. To ensure equitable ICT access, the ways that different age, gender and family groups became aligned with particular social spaces within remote Aboriginal contexts needs to be considered in ICT planning.</Content>

    <Content>Residents’ degree of mobility, both within and outside the community, has implications for ICT provision in relation to access, ownership, management of billing and sustainability. ICT arrangements need to be flexible in response to residential mobility, and some devices and equipment may be more suitable than others depending on community members’ degree of mobility. For instance, residents moved houses within the community for a range of reasons, including available housing stock, maintenance issues in some houses, the cost of power, and cultural customs surrounding death. Such inter-community mobility has consequences for fixed infrastructure costs such as satellite dishes.</Content>

    <Content>Contrary to views that Aboriginal people prefer group learning because they are communally-oriented, we found that community members generally preferred learning opportunities that were flexible enough to accommodate their lifestyle and priorities, and were provided within their homes, often on an individual basis. Individual or home-based learning is possibly also preferred as a way to avoid situations in which their lack of skill is on display, leading to feelings of embarrassment (shame). Although logistically challenging and resource intensive, a flexible, opportunistic approach that tailors learning opportunities to the individual’s needs and takes place within private, safe spaces rather than formal, structured group learning is more likely to be effective. These observations were supported by the experience of Papunya Computer Room (PCR), which mostly offered one-on-one training in response to the failure of attempts at group program delivery.</Content>
