# Names and Permissions

The research described in this book was conducted with the informed
consent of the communities involved. The individuals concerned gave
their approval for the anecdotes to be published. Each individual was
given a choice as to whether they wanted their name to appear in the
book. Residents from Kwale Kwale and Mungalawurru chose to use their own
names, while those at Imangara chose pseudonyms. We also obtained
permission from senior residents for the descriptions of the three
communities, use of community names, numerous small details, and the
overall arguments of the chapters. We presented draft information on
Papunya and Ali Curung to senior community members in order to obtain
feedback.Â
