Abstract: 'Internet on the Outstation' provides a new take on the digital divide. Why do whole communities choose to go without the internet when the infrastructure for access is in place? Through an in-depth exploration of the digital practices occurring in Aboriginal households in remote central Australia, the authors address both the dynamics of internet adoption and the benefits that flow from its use. The book challenges us to think beyond the standard explanations for the digital divide, arguing that digital exclusion is not just another symptom of social exclusion. At its heart, 'Internet on the Outstation' is a compelling examination of equality and difference in the digital age, asking: Can internet access help resolve the disadvantages associated with remote living?
