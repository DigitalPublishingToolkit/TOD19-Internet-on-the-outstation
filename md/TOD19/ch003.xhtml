<h1>Names and Permissions</h1>
<p>The research described in this book was conducted with the informed consent of the communities involved. The individuals concerned gave their approval for the anecdotes to be published. Each individual was given a choice as to whether they wanted their name to appear in the book. Residents from Kwale Kwale and Mungalawurru chose to use their own names, while those at Imangara chose pseudonyms. We also obtained permission from senior residents for the descriptions of the three communities, use of community names, numerous small details, and the overall arguments of the chapters. We presented draft information on Papunya and Ali Curung to senior community members in order to obtain feedback.Â </p>
