##Appendix 1: Transition to the National Broadband Network (NBN) Interim Satellite Service (ISS)

Take-up of ISS services for the majority of householders was consistent
with their intentions in September 2013. In total, ten households
(compared with seventeen households or community buildings originally
connected in the project) ultimately retained the use of the internet.
There has been considerable change in the total composition of
households engaged in the project since the original implementation in
mid-2011: a number of households were added and/or changed resident
members, and most of the shared building computers were re-distributed
to individual households along the way. The table below summarizes these
changes.

## Appendix 2: Location and Movement of the Computers in the Communities 

Eleven computers were installed in Imangara from late July to early
August 2011; two were located in the Women’s Centre for use by the
general community and by the couple running the Centre, while the
remainder were installed in individual houses. Later in the project, an
additional three computers were installed in individual houses not
originally included in the study (Figure 1). Although this community
building is called the Women’s Centre, this space is not the exclusive
domain of women. Some men regularly visited the Women’s Centre, and at
least two men were frequent users of its computers during the project.

households in Imangara that participated in the study in July 2011 with
later additions up to the end of September 2013 noted

In Mungalawurru, five computers were installed in June 2011, three in
individual houses and two in what was referred to as the ‘CDEP shed’,
which was considered to be a public space accessible by all community
members (Figure 2). One of these was notionally allocated to a female
resident, while the other was understood to be a computer for shared use
by those community members who did not receive household computers.

Within the first twelve months of the project’s longitudinal phase, 45
per cent of participants at Imangara and 80 per cent of participants at
Mungalawurru had signed formal ownership agreements. Additional formal
take-up occurred between September 2012 and September 2013: one
participant at Mugalawurru, and two residents at Imangara – one of whom
was not initially involved in the HIP study – signed formal ownership
agreements. By the end of September 2013, 69 per cent of computers at
Imangara and 100 per cent of those at Mungalawurru were subject to
formal ownership agreements.

Despite equipment failure, loss or damage, an average of seventeen of
the twenty computers installed by early August 2011 were operational
during the nine months through to the end of April 2014. (Two computers
failed but could be repaired, another was taken out of the community and
returned with components missing, and the only laptop was irreparably
damaged by a small child.)

By comparison with this total of twenty-two computer failures over the
twenty-five-month project period, a large survey of failure rates in
corporate desktop computers referenced at
[*http://www.partnerinfo.lenovo.com/partners/us/products/downloads/thinkcentre-mseries/TBR-Quality-Study-ExecSummary.pdf*](http://www.partnerinfo.lenovo.com/partners/us/products/downloads/thinkcentre-mseries/TBR-Quality-Study-ExecSummary.pdf)
recorded an average 15.29 per cent failure rate, requiring warranty
repair over the first two years of service, or 3.5 failures for an
equivalent population of twenty-two computers over twenty-five months.
